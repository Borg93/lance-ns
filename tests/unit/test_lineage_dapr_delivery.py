"""Seam 1 (DAPR): the lineage ingest as the SIDECAR actually drives it, not the handler in isolation.

``tests/unit/test_consumer.py`` calls :func:`handle_cloud_event` directly, so it pins the ack contract
but never sees the route. Everything between the sidecar and that function was unproven:

* the **subscription contract** the sidecar reads at startup (GET ``/dapr/subscribe``) — pubsub name,
  topic and route. A renamed route or topic silently stops ALL durable ingest (the sidecar 404s /
  subscribes to a topic nobody publishes); nothing else in the suite would notice. Only the
  *DLQ-configured* variant was pinned (``test_dapr_dlq.py``), never the default one the chart ships
  before ``dapr.resiliency.enabled``.
* the **token guard on the delivery route**. ``on_lineage_event`` declares
  ``Depends(require_dapr_token)``, which a direct call to ``handle_cloud_event`` cannot exercise —
  drop the dependency and every direct-call test still passes while the graph becomes forgeable.
* **redelivery**. Dapr is at-least-once and the handler answers ``RETRY``, so duplicates are the
  NORMAL case, and the whole design rests on "the graph is idempotent (nodes/edges MERGE)". That
  claim was only checked against real AGE in the e2e tier (``test_lineage_e2e.py``), i.e. never in CI.
* the **DLQ parking route** for lineage. Its subscription *declaration* was pinned; its behaviour
  (ERROR-log + ACK + the terminal-loss counter + the 403) was only pinned for medallion's twin.
