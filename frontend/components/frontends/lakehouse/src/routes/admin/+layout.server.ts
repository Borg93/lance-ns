/**
 * The estate-admin door, ON THE SERVER.
 *
 * The root layout already refuses to render the admin area to a non-admin, but that gate runs in the
 * BROWSER: the server still compiled and shipped every admin route's HTML and JS, and only then did the
 * client fetch `/v1/me` and swap in ForbiddenPage. Nothing was disclosed that the backend would have
 * served — every panel's data comes from the catalog or the lineage plane, which enforce estate-admin
 * in FGA themselves, so a non-admin got an empty shell and a wall of 403s. But "the data layer says no"
 * is one layer, and the admin area is the one place in the estate where it should be three.
 *
 * So the door is here too, and here it is FIRST: an identity that is not `estate_admin` gets a 403 from
 * the load, before a single admin component is rendered or sent. Fail-closed on every ambiguity —
 * `fetchMe` returns null for no token, a 401/403, a timeout, an unreachable catalog or a response that
 * drifted from the frozen contract, and all of those land in the same branch as "not an admin".
 *
 * Auth-off stacks (dev servers, the three non-admin e2e areas) keep their current behaviour: with no
 * OIDC configured there is no identity to check and the backend answers `estate_admin: true` anyway.
