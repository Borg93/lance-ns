// @repo/api/gateway — route SSR `/api/*` fetches to the in-cluster gateway.
//
// Under `svelte-adapter-bun` (prod), a server-side fetch of a RELATIVE `/api/*`
// URL resolves against the *incoming request's* origin — the EXTERNAL ingress
// host — so the pod hairpins out through the ingress and back in (and hard-fails
// when that origin isn't reachable from inside the cluster). This is a SvelteKit
// `handleFetch` factory: during SSR it rewrites same-origin `/api/*` requests to
// the in-cluster gateway base, so server reads go straight to the gateway.
// Client-side fetches are never touched (the browser's relative `/api` is
// same-origin and correct).
//
// Env-free ON PURPOSE: @repo/api is also imported in client bundles, so it must
// not import `$env/*/private`. The gateway URL is passed in from each app's
// (server-only) `hooks.server.ts`. Single-sourcing the rewrite here means every
// app — and every future @repo/api endpoint — inherits it with no per-call wiring.

/** The subset of SvelteKit's `handleFetch` input this factory reads. Kept
 *  structural so @repo/api stays dependency-light (no `@sveltejs/kit` import);
 *  the result is assignable to `HandleFetch`, which apps annotate it with. */
