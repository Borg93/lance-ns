"""Submit a runner's worker to a Ray cluster as a Ray Job — never by shelling out.

Mirrors lance-ns ``services/medallion/services/ray_submit.submit_stage_job`` so
the two seams read identically at merge: a DETERMINISTIC submission id per
(runner, token) makes resubmission idempotent (a second submit of the same work
re-attaches to the running job instead of racing it), the runner's own env rides
in the job's ``runtime_env``, and ``metadata={"kind": <runner>}`` labels the job
in the Ray dashboard. Differences from lance-ns, on purpose:

* **sync, SDK client** — ratch submits from a CLI (Typer), not an async Dapr
  mover, so this uses ``ray.job_submission.JobSubmissionClient`` directly
  (rask's ``ray-kit`` shape) instead of async httpx against the REST API.
* **a terminal prior job is ALWAYS deleted + resubmitted** — lance-ns re-attaches
  to a SUCCEEDED job because its trigger is an at-least-once redelivery of the
  same event; ratch's trigger is a human asking for a (re)build, so a finished
  job of any outcome means "run it again", while a still-running one means
  "attach, don't race".

When ``ray_enabled`` is off (the default — lance-ns's ``MEDALLION_RAY_ENABLED``
shape), the worker runs in-process instead: same entrypoint contract
(``runners/<name>/worker.py::main`` reading argv), no cluster needed. That only
works when the runner's deps are importable here; conflicting-env runners
(topics, kg) run locally through their sealed envs via Make targets instead.
