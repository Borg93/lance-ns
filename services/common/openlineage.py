"""Shared OpenLineage spec constants + helpers for every lance-ns event emitter.

Keeping these in one place is what makes our hand-built ``RunEvent``s spec-true (and therefore
reusable by a Marquez-style consumer): a valid **UUID** ``runId``, the **required** top-level
``schemaURL``, and the ``_producer`` / ``_schemaURL`` every facet — standard OR custom — must carry.

We hand-build the wire dicts rather than importing ``openlineage-python``: the client is a **dev-only**
dependency (``[dependency-groups] dev`` in ``pyproject.toml``) and is deliberately kept out of the service
images, so ``lineage.seed`` (the demo producer) is the only module that constructs events through the
official ``event_v2`` / ``facet_v2`` classes. What makes the hand-built path safe is that these constants
are asserted EQUAL to the official facet classes' ``_get_schema()`` by
``tests/unit/test_openlineage_spec_conformance.py`` — bumping ``openlineage-python`` reddens CI the moment
a facet's published version moves. That gate was missing until 2026-07-26, and three of the URLs below had
already drifted (``SchemaDatasetFacet`` 1-1-1→1-2-0, ``DatasourceDatasetFacet`` and ``ErrorMessageRunFacet``
1-0-0→1-0-1 — the 1-0-0 facets ``$ref`` the retired ``1-0-2`` core spec while our envelope declares 2-0-2).
