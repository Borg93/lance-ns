"""#50 maintenance policies — the shared registry, the sweep's policy logic, and the protection proof.

The registry round-trips against a local filesystem root (``fs_and_base`` falls back to the local FS).
The tag-protection test is real Lance, not a mock: it pins the load-bearing claim that a tag-pinned
version survives any retention policy (``cleanup_old_versions`` exempts tagged versions), because the
whole feature is unsafe if that ever regresses.
