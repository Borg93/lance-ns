"""Unit tests for the revoke-on-delete path (common.fga + catalog.fga_deps).

A dropped / renamed-away object's FGA tuples must be removed, or a later object reusing the id
inherits the old grants (stale-grant privilege bleed). These pin the read+delete contract WITHOUT
the network: the paginated read returns the COMPLETE set, the delete issues exactly those tuples,
an already-absent delete is idempotent, and an OpenFGA outage fails closed (503).

Uses stdlib ``asyncio.run`` so no pytest-asyncio dependency is needed (matches test_fga_resilience).
