					(absent from a list → adds 0). So it's a
					<strong class="text-foreground">union with added scores</strong>
					— not a chain, and not a plain concatenation. Because it's just a sum, it extends to
					<strong class="text-foreground">any number of lists</strong>
					(2 for Hybrid, up to 4 for <code class="font-mono">all</code>) — you add one more term per
					leg. A chunk only one leg found still shows up (it just scores low); a chunk several legs
