"""#53 Ray BATCH path — the distributed-Lance capability job on a real KubeRay cluster.

Submits ``scripts/ray_lance_job.py`` to the deployed ray-lance-demo cluster and asserts its four
distributed effects observably (write at 2.2 + stable row ids, a scalar index that serves a query,
schema evolution, compaction), so the "distributed Lance write/index/evolve/compact on real Ray"
claim can never silently regress. Distributed where the lance_ray↔pylance versions align, native
fallback (documented) where they do not.

This job writes throwaway ``ray-<run>/`` demo datasets and emits NO lineage by design — governed
batch provenance lives in the medallion Ray stage path (``ray_stage_job.py``), covered by the
governed-union suite. See docs/RAY.md.

Env: LANCE_E2E_RAY_HEAD_DEPLOY (default deploy/ray-lance-head) — the suite ``kubectl exec``s the head
to run ``ray job submit``; skips cleanly when kubectl or the head is absent.
