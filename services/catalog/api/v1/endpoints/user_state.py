"""``/v1/user-state/*`` — a signed-in person's own work, stored per subject on the Dapr state store.

The media zone's workflow canvas and its saved views were ``localStorage``, so the same person on another
machine (or after clearing site data) found an empty canvas. These routes give both documents a home the
estate owns; :mod:`common.user_state` holds the store client and the key rules, and
:mod:`common.schemas.workflow` mirrors the zone's valibot schemas so a document round-trips unchanged.

**Why the catalog owns this.** Only two app-ids are in the state store's ``scopes``
(``chart/values.yaml`` → ``stateStore.scopes``): ``annotator`` and ``catalog``. Of those two, only the
catalog has a verified subject to key on — ``services/annotator/main.py`` builds no ``OIDCVerifier`` and
``services/annotator/api/dependencies.py`` re-exports only ``AuthorDep``, whose ``get_author``
(``common/deps.py``) reads a **trusted ``X-User`` header** and defaults to ``"anon"``. Per-subject storage
keyed on a client-settable header is the exact leak these routes exist to prevent. The catalog instead has
``api/security.py``'s ``CurrentToken``, the router-wide ``Depends(authorize)`` that 401s an anonymous
caller, and — the reachability half — a BFF proxy the media zone already uses
(``routes/capi/v1/me/+server.ts`` → ``makeCatalogProxy``), which forwards the signed-in user's bearer and
nothing else.

**Authenticated-only, and self-scoped by construction.** There is no FGA object here because there is no
shared resource: the only thing a caller can address is their own document, and *which* document is a
closed enum baked into the URL path, never an identity. ``/v1/user-state`` matches no resource prefix in
``fga_deps.authorize`` and carries no ``{id}`` path param, so the router-wide gate contributes exactly its
401/503 pre-checks — the ``/v1/me`` precedent. The 401 floor is asserted here as well, so it also holds
with FGA off. Not audited, for the same reason ``/v1/me`` is not: the #41 trail records authorization
DECISIONS, and there is no decision to record when the resource is definitionally the caller's own.

**``response_model_exclude_none`` is load-bearing, not tidiness.** The zone parses these documents with
valibot, where an edge's ``targetHandle`` is ``v.optional(v.string())`` — absent is fine, ``null`` is a
parse FAILURE that would drop the whole graph back to a seeded canvas. ``SearchSpec`` is likewise written
under ``exactOptionalPropertyTypes`` as ``T | undefined``. Omitting nulls is what keeps the round trip
lossless; ``exists`` carries the had-it-or-not signal that a nullable ``value`` would otherwise have to.
