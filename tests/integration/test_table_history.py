"""``GET /v1/table/{id}/history`` — the commit log, read out of the format.

The question this answers is the Lakekeeper-console one the owner asked for: *what changed in the data, and
when*. Lance is immutable and append-only at the manifest level, so the answer is already in the dataset —
``versions()`` for the timestamps, the transaction log for the substance — rather than in a side-table the
catalog would have to keep in sync with the data it describes.

Driven end to end through the real ``dir`` backend and real pylance writes, because the whole value of the
endpoint is that it reports what Lance ACTUALLY recorded. A mocked namespace would only pin the shape we
imagined the transaction log has, and the shape is exactly the thing worth verifying — it is why this feature
was scoped from a probe rather than from the docs.
