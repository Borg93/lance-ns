"""Dapr pub/sub subscriber — the durable ingest path for catalog→lineage events (#25).

The catalog publishes OpenLineage events to the Dapr ``pubsub.jetstream`` component; the Dapr sidecar
persists them to NATS JetStream and delivers each to this service over HTTP (a CloudEvent envelope). The
handler ingests into Apache AGE and returns a Dapr status: ``SUCCESS`` (ack), ``RETRY`` (transient — the
sidecar redelivers per the component's ``backOff``/``maxDeliver``, then dead-letters), or ``DROP`` (a
malformed payload that redelivery can't fix). Redelivery is safe: the authoritative graph is idempotent
(nodes/edges MERGE on ``run_id``) and the durable events feed dedups on its ``(run_id, event_type,
event_time)`` natural key — only the ``Run.events_count`` is a plain delivery counter (so a redelivery
bumps it). The sidecar owns retry/backoff/DLQ/trace-propagation as component config, not app code (the
decoupled microservice path — microservices.md).

Trust model: the topic is an internal, catalog-only channel, so the handler **trusts the verified
``author`` the catalog stamped** — the anti-forgery ``enforce_author`` guard is only for the open HTTP
``/api/v1/lineage`` endpoint, where any producer could lie.
