"""The maintenance sweep: discover every dataset in the bucket, compact + GC each, aggregate the result.

Since #50, a per-table/namespace maintenance policy (from the catalog's ``_policies/`` registry) can skip
a dataset (``policy_disabled`` / ``policy_interval``) or override its old-version retention; a policy-less
dataset keeps the global defaults. Keeps the blocking S3/Lance orchestration out of the route so the cron
handler stays a thin shell and the aggregation (:func:`summarize`) stays unit-testable without S3.
