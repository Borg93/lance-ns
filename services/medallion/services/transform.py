"""The mover's stage-transform business logic — one DAG edge, infra-free + testable.

:func:`handle_stage` is the heart of a medallion mover: given one upstream stage trigger it emits the
transform's OpenLineage event (``inputs=[from_dataset]`` -> ``outputs=[to_dataset]`` — the ``DERIVED_FROM``
edge) and publishes the next stage's trigger, so a single producer event cascades raw->bronze->silver->gold.

Idempotent + best-effort: with ``compute_enabled`` the transform does a REAL in-process Lance write (the
fake-Ray compute) and the emit carries the real version; off, it's a pure lineage emit (version 1). The
graph MERGEs on run_id, and a compute/publish outage returns ``RETRY`` so the Dapr sidecar redelivers.
When the FGA gate is on, the mover
CHECKS it is authorized to produce the target stage as its own service identity before emitting — an
unauthorized mover returns ``DROP`` (redelivery won't grant the role), so the cascade enforces the ReBAC.
