"""End-to-end test for the event-driven medallion cascade (lance-ray → 3 movers → lineage DAG).

ONE call to lance-ray's ``/produce`` must cascade the whole pipeline — raw → bronze → silver → gold —
purely through Dapr pub/sub, and the lineage graph must end up showing gold transitively derived from
raw. This is the regression guard for "the medallion services are wired and the triggers chain".

Run (port-forward lance-ray + lineage to distinct local ports first), or `make e2e-medallion`:

    kubectl port-forward svc/lance-ns-lance-ray 8002:8000 &
    kubectl port-forward svc/lance-ns-lineage   8000:8000 &
    LANCE_E2E_LANCERAY_URL=http://localhost:8002 LANCE_E2E_LINEAGE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
    uv run pytest tests/e2e/test_medallion_e2e.py -v
