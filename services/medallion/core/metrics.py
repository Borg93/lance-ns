"""OpenTelemetry domain metrics for the medallion pipeline.

The golden signal for the cascade: how many stage transitions each mover completed. Exported via the
OTel SDK (``opentelemetry-instrument``) over OTLP to GreptimeDB, queryable in PromQL / Perses. Bounded
cardinality — only the namespaced ``lance.medallion.transition`` label (e.g. ``raw->bronze``); per-run ids
stay on spans/logs. (Namespaced per the otel skill; in PromQL the dots become underscores →
``lance_medallion_transition``.)
