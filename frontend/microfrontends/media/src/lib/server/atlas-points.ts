/**
 * The server half of the atlas-points fix: `GET ${base}/api/atlas/points`, cached in THIS zone's BFF.
 *
 * The measurement, taken 2026-07-26 through the ingress on this cluster:
 *
 *   $ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{size_download}\n' \
 *       'http://localhost:8090/media/api/atlas/points?space=text&v=6'
 *   200 6678928
 *
 * `UrlMemo` in `@repo/media-api` already stops the same tab paying that twice, which is what the
 * Text/Visual toggle used to do. It cannot help a refresh, a second tab or a second user, and a burst of
 * concurrent multi-megabyte reads is what OOM-killed the viewer (`exit 137`) and took the media plane to
 * 502. So this route sits in front of the same upstream the `/api/[...path]` catch-all would have used
 * and adds the half that lives in the server, on {@link SharedPayloadCache}: authorize every request,
 * key on the resource, single-flight.
 *
 * ## The authorization, and what it is worth today
 *
 * That same curl is the whole problem statement for the security half: it carried **no session and no
 * bearer**, and it was answered with the full projection. `makeViewerProxy` forwards a bearer when there
 * is one and shrugs when there is not, and the viewer service registers no authentication at all
 * (`services/common/core/middleware.py` adds CORS and deliberately nothing else). So before this route
 * existed, `/media/api/atlas/points` was an open read for anyone who could reach the ingress — and a
 * cache in front of an unauthorized read would have made a fast open read out of a slow one.
 *
 * Two checks therefore run on EVERY call, before any cached byte is reachable:
 *
 * 1. **A session, fail-closed.** On an auth-enabled stack a caller with no session gets 401 and the
 *    request never leaves the BFF. This is the same stance `makeBackendProxy({ requireSession: true })`
 *    takes on the write routes; the difference is only that a 6.6 MB dataset-wide projection is not a
 *    read this estate should hand to an anonymous socket.
 * 2. **An authorization probe against the same resource, with the caller's own credential.** `GET
 *    /api/atlas/status?space=&dataset=` is the cheap sibling of `/points`: same dataset handle, same
 *    space resolution, ~25 ms and 99 bytes against the 6.6 MB it guards. Its verdict is used once and
 *    discarded — {@link SharedPayloadCache} caches the payload and never the decision. Today the viewer
 *    answers it for any caller, so the probe's real value is structural: the day the media corpus moves
 *    onto the governed warehouse (`#103`) and the viewer starts FGA-checking the dataset, this route
 *    withholds warm bytes from a refused caller with no further change. It is wired now, and tested now,
 *    because retrofitting an authorization check onto a warm cache is the shape of bug that ships.
 *
 * ## The store: in-process, per replica — and what that costs
 *
 * `chart/values-prod.yaml` sets `frontend.replicas: 2` with no session affinity, so two users can land on
 * different zone pods. What an in-process cache means there, precisely: the projection is materialised at
 * most **once per replica per freshness window**, not once per user. With two replicas the estate pays 2
 * cold fills per 5 minutes instead of one per mount, every subsequent user on either pod is warm, and the
 * concurrency that actually killed the viewer is collapsed on each pod by single-flight.
 *
 * A shared store would buy the difference between 2 cold fills and 1, and it would cost a 6.6 MB
 * round-trip on every hit — replacing an in-cluster read from the viewer with an in-cluster read from
 * Redis, plus a dependency and a failure mode this zone does not have today. That is not a trade worth
 * making at N=2. It becomes worth revisiting if replicas grow (the cold-fill count is linear in N) or if
 * the viewer's 1536Mi tier is squeezed again; the right answer then is an HTTP cache in the edge that
 * already sees `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` on this response (nginx `proxy_cache`), not a Redis
 * holding multi-megabyte blobs — the payload is already an immutable, versioned, dataset-wide HTTP body,
 * which is precisely what an HTTP cache is for. Either way it is a chart change, and chart/ is not this
 * scope's to edit.

/**
 * `v` is deliberately NOT here, and the omission is the fix for a real hole rather than an oversight.
 *
 * It is a caller-supplied, unvalidated token. While it was part of the key, any signed-in user could mint
 * unbounded distinct keys — each one a full 6.6 MB upstream read and a retained 6.6 MB entry. Measured
 * against the live estate: six junk tokens evicted the product entry (`x-cache: hit` → `miss`), and twenty
 * tokens from ONE session added twenty reads to the viewer's own access log — 133 MB on demand, the shared
 * entry permanently cold, and single-flight defeated because every key was unique. That is precisely the
 * burst of concurrent multi-megabyte reads that OOM-killed the viewer in the first place.
 *
 * Dropping it is safe because the upstream does not read it: `services/viewer/api/v1/endpoints/atlas.py`
 * takes `space` and `dataset` only. `v` exists for the BROWSER memo, where a bump must make old entries
 * unreachable in a tab; here the freshness bound is MAX_AGE_MS, which does the same job without letting a
 * caller choose the key.
 *
 * The earlier test asserted that `?cachebust=` and `?user=` were dropped, so cache-forking read as closed
 * while the one parameter that was kept was the unbounded one. A test that proves the good cases and skips
 * the live one is worse than no test, because it is believed.
