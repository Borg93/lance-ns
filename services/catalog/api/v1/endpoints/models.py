"""#17/#42 model-registry endpoints: registry listing, candidate→blessed promotion, and a describe read.

The model registry is a Lance dataset per model at ``settings.model_uri(model)`` (the medallion trainer
writes it there directly). These routes ARE under the router-level ``authorize`` dependency — its pre-path
checks still run here (missing token → 401; FGA enabled but unwired → 503, fail-closed) — but ``/v1/model``
matches no ``_RESOURCES`` prefix, so ``authorize`` makes no per-object decision. The per-object FGA gate is
therefore explicit per handler: promote → the validator rung ``can_promote``; describe → the reader rung
``can_get_metadata``; list → the same reader rung as a ``list_objects`` filter — all on
``table:models$<model>`` (the per-model FGA object the trainer seeds at train time, so the rung cascades
from ``namespace:models``). That router-level fail-closed floor is what keeps the list filter's
``fga_enabled and token and client`` guards from ever being a fail-open path. Promotion moves the
``blessed`` Lance tag after a fail-closed metrics gate; a distinct promotion RunEvent is emitted
best-effort so the blessing lands in lineage without being mistaken for a training run.
