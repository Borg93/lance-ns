"""Guard against frontend↔backend schema drift (#24).

The frontend zones generate their TypeScript catalog/lineage types from the committed
``docs/{catalog,lineage}-openapi.json`` specs (``bun run gen:types:catalog``), which ``make openapi`` dumps
from these FastAPI apps. If a route or response model is added/changed but the committed spec isn't
regenerated, the generated frontend types silently lie. This test fails when a committed spec no longer
covers its live app.

To fix a failure: run ``make openapi`` and commit the updated ``docs/*-openapi.json`` (then re-run the
frontend's ``bun run gen:types:catalog`` if the catalog spec changed).

(Pre-P5 this read ``frontend/apps/web/openapi.json``; that path was retired with apps/web, and the zones now
consume ``docs/*-openapi.json`` directly — so the guard moved here, alongside the ``make openapi-check`` CI
gate that catches the same drift from the other direction.)
