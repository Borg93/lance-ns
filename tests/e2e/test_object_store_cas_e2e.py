"""Object-store compare-and-swap (conditional-write) validation — the load-bearing assumption behind
Lance commit safety.

Every Lance commit publishes ``_versions/N.manifest`` with put-if-not-exists (``If-None-Match: *``); the
format REQUIRES the store to guarantee exactly ONE writer wins that race (``lance_docs/file_format.md`` —
Conflict resolution). A store that silently IGNORES the header accepts both PUTs and silently loses a
commit — a failure mode seen in the wild (GCS S3-interop), invisible to a single-writer smoke test. This
suite is the contended-writer harness that actually catches it, run against the DEPLOYED store (RustFS).

Three tiers, asserting DATA invariants (winner counts / row counts), not exception names — no S3 error
name is contractual:
  1. conditional-PUT pre-flight — a second ``If-None-Match: *`` PUT of a live key must be REJECTED (412);
  2. 8-thread barrier-gated contended-key stress — exactly ONE winner per round (the silent-ignore detector);
  3. 8-process Lance ``append`` stress — Append⊥Append never logically conflicts, so ALL writers must land
     (800/800 rows) — proving Lance's real manifest-CAS commit path survives contention on this store.

Run: ``make e2e-cas`` (port-forwards RustFS + sets LANCE_E2E_S3_*). Writes under ``__cas_stress/`` — the
compaction sweep skips ``__`` prefixes, so this never collides with the lakehouse or gets GC'd.
