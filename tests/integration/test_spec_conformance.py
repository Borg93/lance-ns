"""Conformance: every lance-namespace spec operation has a served catalog route (todo P1 #9).

Locks the catalog as a FAITHFUL REST surface over the spec — a spec op never wired, or a route renamed
away from the spec, turns this red. Routes are read from ``app.openapi()`` (NOT ``app.routes``): starlette
1.3's lazy ``include_router`` keeps included routes off ``app.routes``, so ``openapi()`` is the authoritative
served set. The app may serve MORE than the spec (the ``/credentials`` vending extension + health probes) —
we assert only that the spec is a SUBSET of what's served, on (method, structural-path).
