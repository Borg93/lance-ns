"""Read sensitive secrets from the Dapr secret store at boot — so the store is actually CONSUMED.

The security audit flagged that the OpenBao/Dapr secret store was wired but never read: services still
took their secrets from plaintext pod env, making the integration decorative — AND that the plaintext
secret still shipped in env, so reading it from the store on top was redundant, not protective. The fix:
when ``secrets_from_dapr`` is on, the chart omits the sensitive value from pod env entirely and the
service fetches its secret bundle from the local sidecar's secret store
(``GET /v1.0/secrets/<store>/<key>``) at startup as the SOLE source — retrying while the store seeds, and
failing closed (not silently booting on an empty key) if it never arrives. So the store is genuinely the
source of truth and the plaintext secret no longer lives in the environment.
