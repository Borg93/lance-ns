# The e2e stack + suite runner — the SINGLE definition used by BOTH `make e2e-ci` and the CI job,
# so "it passed in CI" and "it passed on my machine" cannot diverge (the repo's dagger/auth-e2e pattern).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (docs/GOAL-prove-it.md P0.1): every "live-verified" claim in this repo rested on a
# MANUAL terminal run while `ci.yml` ran `pytest -m "not e2e"`. Nothing guarded them, so a regression
# tomorrow would be silent. This script makes the live proof an artifact that runs on every push.
#
# It brings up the GOVERNED stack (Dex OIDC + OpenFGA + Dapr + RustFS + AGE) on kind with the feature
# flags the suites need, seeds the exact grants/buckets they assume, then runs the five e2e suites the
# goal names: CAS, client-direct (#2), warehouses (#3-A), multibase (#3-B), outbox (#4).
#
# Heavy optional components (observability/Vector/Perses/Greptime, web, compaction) are DISABLED — they
# are not under test here and a GitHub runner is 2 cores / 7 GB. `make e2e-obs` covers observability.
