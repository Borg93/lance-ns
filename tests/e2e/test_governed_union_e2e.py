"""Governed FULL-UNION e2e — the shipped combination, driven live (§7's last coverage hole).

Every flag at once: **OIDC auth ON + OpenFGA ON (catalog, lineage reads, movers) + compute ON +
quality gate ON**, against the real kind stack (Dapr/NATS/AGE/RustFS/Dex/OpenFGA). The recurring bug
class here is the never-driven union — each feature green in isolation while the composition breaks —
so this suite asserts, live:

  1. the governed ALLOW path: one ``/produce`` cascades raw→bronze→silver→gold with the seeded service
     grants, correlated by the deterministic per-stage run ids; quality verdicts recorded; and the same
     stack really enforces (anon → 401, ungranted user → 403);
  2. FGA-deny → DROP: with the gold validator tuple revoked, the SAME drive stops at silver — gold's
     run never lands — and re-granting makes the next drive cascade again (the tuple is the only delta);
  3. quality-block: a bad batch (null ids) written to bronze is derived into silver, the gate records
     ``quality_passed=false`` + the failed ``not_null`` assertion in lineage, and gold is NOT triggered;
  4. the MEDIA lane under governance: ``/ingest-media`` lands blobs + derives thumbnail/embedding with
     the seeded ``service-media-to-silver`` grant, all read back through the GOVERNED lineage API.

Deploy the union + seed, then ``make e2e-governed-union`` (which port-forwards + seeds + fills env):

    helm upgrade --install lance-ns ./chart --set image.catalog.tag=dev --set image.web.tag=dev \\
      --set auth.enabled=true --set medallion.fgaEnabled=true \\
      --set medallion.compute=true --set medallion.quality=true --set openbao.enabled=false

Human lineage reads work because ``scripts/seed_medallion_fga.sh`` links every cascade dataset to its
stage namespace (table→namespace parent tuples) — the suite only grants its own reader on the warehouse.

    # against OpenFGA's tuple validation): an OpenFGA object id must contain exactly one ':', so

    # ungovernable-per-object and therefore invisible to EVERY governed principal. That is the
    # contract; making sources governable would need an id-encoding scheme or a `namespace:source`
    # parent with encoded ids (logged in todo_fable §7a as the open design decision).
