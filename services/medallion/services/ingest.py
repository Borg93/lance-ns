"""Land external source objects into a bronze Lance blob table — the ingest head of the cascade.

Reads a provider-agnostic ``SourceAdapter`` (:mod:`common.sources`) and writes each object's bytes as a
managed blob-v2 column at file format 2.2, keeping the object's source URI as a column so provenance
survives in the data itself (the caller emits the ``source -> bronze`` lineage edge from ``source_uris``).
The per-stage ML then flows the blob forward (``compute._carry_forward``) and derives the silver artifacts.

    commit via Lance's NATIVE streaming write.

    Raises ``ValueError`` on an empty source (checked by a peek BEFORE any write touches storage): an empty
    bronze is almost always a mis-set prefix, and silently "succeeding" with zero rows would report a false
    success (and an input-less lineage edge) up the cascade.

    LANCE-NATIVE STREAMING WRITE (2026-07-13 — replaced the hand-rolled overwrite-then-append multi-commit
    chunking after checking the Lance guide: ``write_dataset`` accepts ``Iterator[RecordBatch]`` + ``schema``
    and streams it with bounded memory, so the multi-commit loop was a DIY copy of a shipped feature).
    Objects are batched into RecordBatches — ``chunk_objects`` OR ``chunk_bytes``, WHICHEVER TRIPS FIRST:
    the object count alone would let 64 large images balloon one batch toward the whole total ceiling,
    so the byte bound is the real memory guarantee and the count bound is batching hygiene (many tiny
    objects still amortize into sensibly-sized batches). Memory high-water is ONE batch plus the
    accumulated URI strings, regardless of source size; fragment/file layout inside the commit is Lance's
    own job (``max_rows_per_file``/``max_bytes_per_file`` defaults). Neither knob is a Dapr/NATS
    constraint — the bus never carries payload bytes (claim-check: events are pointers).

    ONE COMMIT, ATOMIC (probed): the version bumps exactly once per ingest — the lineage WROTE edge and the
    readable result are the same handle — and a mid-ingest failure commits NOTHING: an aborted re-ingest
    leaves the PREVIOUS bronze fully readable (the old multi-commit path could not promise this — its first
    chunk had already overwritten). Orphaned data files from an abort carry no manifest and the next
    successful overwrite supersedes them.

    The CEILINGS remain the refusal guard (clear ``ValueError`` naming the env knob, mapped to 400 at the
    route) against a mis-pointed prefix: bounded memory does not make a million-object ingest a good idea.
    They are enforced INSIDE the batch generator, and Lance's FFI wraps a generator's exception in
    ``OSError`` — so the recorded ValueError is re-raised at the boundary to keep the contract.

    EXTERNAL-URI BLOBS deliberately NOT used here: blob v2 can point at external objects
    (``Blob.from_uri``) which would make ingest a zero-copy metadata write, but bronze must OWN its bytes —
    a pointer-only bronze dangles the moment the source bucket's lifecycle deletes or migrates an object
    (exactly the failure mode the reconcile dangling-pointer patrol exists for). Copying once at the ingest
    boundary is the cheap insurance that the lakehouse's ground truth is self-contained.
