"""Best-effort OpenLineage emission from the compaction service to the lineage graph (#7b).

A maintenance sweep compacts small fragments + GCs old versions of each Lance dataset; when
``lineage_emit_enabled`` is on it records each *materially-compacted* dataset as an OpenLineage
``RunEvent`` (output = the dataset, ``operation=compaction``) — and each ``maintain:``-FAILED dataset
as a ``FAIL`` event with the standard ``errorMessage`` facet (§4 failure visibility; deterministic
per-dataset run id as the flood guard) — published to the **Dapr** ``pubsub.jetstream`` component —
the SAME pubsub component + topic the catalog publishes to and the lineage service subscribes to, so
compaction runs (and failures) show up in ``producers()`` alongside the writes.
The sidecar owns retry/backoff + trace-propagation (no DLQ — see docs/RESILIENCE.md gap #2) as component
config (no broker client here).

Self-contained: the compaction service never imports the catalog (zero cross-service imports — the
mergeability invariant). The only shared code is ``common.fga`` for the id↔namespace derivation, so the
lineage ``Dataset`` name == the OpenFGA object id == the catalog table id across all three governance axes.

Two deliberate choices:

* **Versionless.** A compaction is *maintenance*, not a data write, so the event asserts no data version —
  the lineage repository records a ``(:Run)-[:WROTE]->(:Dataset)`` with no version and (no inputs →) no
  ``DERIVED_FROM``. This also keeps it out of ``reconcile``'s ``latest_write_version`` (which must track
  real writes), so a compaction never makes the graph look "ahead" of the last data write.
* **Best-effort.** A sidecar/broker outage logs + drops; auditing must never fail a maintenance sweep.

This layer is **pure** (builders + emitter transports only); the per-sweep orchestration that needs the
:class:`~compaction.services.optimize.DatasetResult` type lives in ``compaction.services.sweep`` so ``core``
never imports up into ``services``.
