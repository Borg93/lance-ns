"""The event-driven cascade head — react to a 'raw batch written' lineage event by firing the pipeline.

lance-ray subscribes to the shared lineage topic (the same events the catalog + producer already emit on a
write) and, **only** for a write to the raw namespace/dataset, publishes the raw stage trigger
(``medallion.raw``) that the raw->bronze mover consumes. So the cascade HEAD is driven by the raw-data
*arrival event*, not a manual call or a timer — every stage, the head included, reacts to an event on the
bus we already run.

**Loop-guarded**: the lineage topic also carries the movers' own bronze/silver/gold writes; those are acked
and ignored (their output namespace isn't raw), so publishing the trigger can never re-fire the head.
Best-effort with ``RETRY`` so a sidecar/broker outage is redelivered rather than dropped.
