"""Best-effort OpenLineage emission from the catalog to the lineage service.

The catalog is the only component that knows the *verified* principal on every write, so it is
the authoritative source of "who created/changed a table". On a table create it emits an
OpenLineage ``RunEvent`` (output = the table, ``author`` = the token sub, plus a ``lance`` run
facet naming the operation + version) to the lineage service's ingest endpoint.

Emission is **inline-awaited + best-effort**: the write endpoints ``await`` it (NOT a FastAPI
BackgroundTasks fire-and-forget — that dies with the worker + can't reach the durable transport before
the response) but it swallows every error, so the lineage service being down/slow can never block or
fail a catalog write. Two transports sit behind the same :class:`LineageEmitter` interface:

* :class:`HttpLineageEmitter` — direct HTTP POST (the OpenLineage default transport; simple, but the
  event is lost if the lineage service is down when we POST). Good for dev / external producers.
* :class:`DaprEmitter` — publish to the **Dapr** ``pubsub.jetstream`` component (the production
  transport, ``LANCE_LINEAGE_TRANSPORT=dapr``). We publish to our local Dapr sidecar; the sidecar
  persists to NATS JetStream and owns retry/backoff/trace-propagation as **component config** (no broker
  client in app code) — the decoupled microservice path. A delivery the subscriber can't process after its
  retry budget dead-letter-parks on a ``dlq.*`` topic (Dapr-native DLQ, default-on via the
  ``dapr.resiliency.enabled`` chart resiliency; the subscriber's ``/dlq-event`` route ERROR-logs + acks —
  park-and-alert, not replay — docs/RESILIENCE.md gap #2, fixed 2026-07-12). The lineage
  service subscribes via its
  own sidecar. The outbox gap (crash between the Lance write and publish) remains: the catalog has no
  DB for a transactional outbox; the durable producer is the Ray job (future), per microservices.md.

    ``inputs`` names the source dataset(s) this write is DERIVED FROM, each optionally version-pinned (a
    rename passes its source; a mover's merge passes ``source@N``); ``extra_run_facets`` rides caller-supplied
    run facets (e.g. training params). Ids come from ``fga`` so the lineage Dataset == the OpenFGA object.
