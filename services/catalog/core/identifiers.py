"""Lance object identifier parsing.

The REST routes carry the ``$``-delimited string identifier in the ``{id}`` path
segment. The root namespace is represented by the delimiter itself.

Object-id *canonicalization* (joining segments into the string OpenFGA stores)
lives in :mod:`common.fga` (``canonical_object_id`` / ``parent_namespace_id``),
so the FGA object string is defined in exactly one place and the grant + check
paths cannot drift apart. This module owns the structural shape of an identifier:
splitting it into segments. (Parent-namespace derivation lives in ``common.fga``.)
