"""The Ray TRAIN head + trainer consumer business logic (#115a, docs/RAY-TRAIN.md D1/D2/D5).

``submit_train_request`` (the ``POST /train`` head) resolves every feature's Lance version — an omitted
version pins to LATEST **at the head** (D1: the pin is resolved here and threaded through, never left
floating inside the job) — then publishes the training trigger to the DEDICATED topic. The trigger
carries pointers only (dataset names + versions + a small config), never data (claim-check).

``handle_train_trigger`` (the subscription consumer) FGA-gates as the trainer's OWN identity —
``can_read_data`` on EVERY pinned input and ``can_create_table`` on the models namespace (D5: never the
medallion writer rung) — then SUBMITS the Ray job and acks (D2: submit-and-ack; the job emits its own
OpenLineage lifecycle). Deny → DROP before any compute is spent; FGA outage → RETRY; a terminally
FAILED prior job → DROP (no auto-resubmit of expensive training).
