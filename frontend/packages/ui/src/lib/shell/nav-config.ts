 * to governance, is a soft navigation inside one router; only Media and Annotate still cross a zone
 * boundary and hard-navigate. The sidebar renders the current AREA's routes (`ZoneNav`).
 *
 * A zone with sub-areas carries `items`, and the navbar renders it as a NavigationMenu trigger with
 * a panel — so the estate's shape is reachable from any zone in one hop instead of landing on a
 * zone root and hunting through its sidebar. Zones with a single surface stay plain links.
 *
 * Admin appends ONLY for an estate admin (`me.estate_admin` from the frozen `/v1/me` contract) —
 * fail-closed: an unresolved/absent `me` renders the base entries. Access is NOT a top-level
 * entry: it lives inside the admin zone (/admin/access), so Admin covers the whole /admin subtree
 * here and Access appears only as one row of Admin's panel.
