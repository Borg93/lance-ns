"""Estate-admin FGA administration API (``/v1/access``): raw tuples, the model text, and a check.

The RAW-tuple counterpart of the per-object ``…/access/*`` surfaces (#51/#68/#72/#81): where those answer
questions about ONE table/namespace at the owner bar, this browses and edits the authorization store
itself — every tuple, any type — so it is gated exactly like ``/v1/events``: the surface is estate-wide,
therefore observing (or mutating) it is a PLATFORM privilege, ``can_observe_events`` on the fixed root
object (``settings.fga_root_object``), decided explicitly per handler because ``/v1/access`` matches no
resource prefix in ``fga_deps.authorize`` (the router gate only sets the 401/503 floor).

Fail-closed and model-true throughout: FGA off → 501 (nothing to administer), an unwired client → 503,
and every relation/type named by a caller is validated against the COMPILED model first, so a phantom
relation or a non-assignable (derived ``can_*``) tuple write is a clean 400 here — never an OpenFGA 400
that fails closed to a 503, and never a write the idempotent-duplicate handling could swallow as success.
Tuple writes/deletes are additionally audited (``access_tuple_write`` / ``access_tuple_delete``, the
``access_grant`` pattern) on top of the gate's allow/deny record; reads audit the disclosure
(``access_tuples_read``), mirroring ``access_review``.
