/**
 * The composed-page bundle budget.
 *
 * Micro-frontends make bundle regressions invisible: each zone looks fine on its own, nobody measures
 * the estate, and the cost only shows up as a slow cross-zone hop. That gets worse now that the zones
 * ship on independent tags — no single release looks at all four. So the ceiling is committed, and
 * raising it is an edit someone has to justify rather than a number that drifts.
 *
 * MEASURED IN TWO HALVES, and that distinction is the whole point of this gate.
 *
 * The first version gzipped every emitted .js/.css together and called the result "what the browser
 * pays to enter a zone". For three zones that was near enough. For the annotator it was false by an
 * order of magnitude: 3809 of its 4179 KB was ONE chunk — a vendored OpenCV wasm build — reached only
 * through a dynamic `import()` inside the magnetic tool, so a session that never picked that tool never
 * downloaded a byte of it. The consequences were worse than the wrong number:
 *
 *   - The annotator read as 4179/4800 KB — 87% of budget "used" — while its real entry cost was 365 KB.
 *     A change that doubled the entry graph would have passed the gate without a murmur, because 400 KB
 *     is noise next to a 3.8 MB constant. The gate could not see the regression it exists to catch.
 *   - It made the estate's shape unreadable. On entry cost the annotator is the SECOND-LIGHTEST zone
 *     (365 KB, against media's 929) — the opposite of what the old number said, and the opposite of
 *     what budget.json's own note claimed.
 *
 * So: `staticGzipKB` is the closure of STATIC imports from every entry Vite emitted (SvelteKit marks
 * entry/start, entry/app and every route node as entries), plus their CSS — code the zone can load
 * without a user action, i.e. what crossing the boundary actually costs. `deferredGzipKB` is
 * everything else: real bytes, but ones the user opts into. Both are ceilinged, because an unbounded
 * lazy payload is still a problem — just a different problem, on a different budget.
 *
 * That split is also what made the 3.8 MB legible enough to kill (#117). Measured against the live
 * deployment, no session ever fetched it: the wasm bought exactly two calls, `cvtColor(RGBA2GRAY)` and
 * `cornerMinEigenVal(5, 3, BORDER_DEFAULT)`, now ~120 lines in `@repo/engine`'s `tools/corners.ts` and
 * pinned to OpenCV's own recorded output. The annotator's deferred half went 3854 KB → 46 KB with its
 * entry graph unchanged at 365 KB. So the gate below no longer asks whether the blob is lazy; it asks
 * that no zone acquires one at all, by name and by size.
 *
 * Read from Vite's own manifest rather than reconstructed by parsing import statements: the manifest
 * distinguishes `imports` from `dynamicImports` at the source of truth, and a regex over minified
 * output cannot tell `import"./x.js"` from `import("./x.js")` reliably.
