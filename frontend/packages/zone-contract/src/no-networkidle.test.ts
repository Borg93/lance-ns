/**
 * No zone test may wait for `networkidle`. It can never fire again, and it fails by TIMING OUT.
 *
 * Every zone's shell now holds a live `query.live` stream open for the notification bell, so these apps
 * have no idle network by design. A `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` or `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` sits
 * until its own timeout on every navigation and then reports a failure that looks like the product hanging.
 *
 * That is exactly how it presented: mounting the bell in the remaining three zones turned one home-zone
 * spec red with `Error: waitForLoadState: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded`, and nine more waits sat in the
 * media zone's live drives waiting to do the same on the next run. The lakehouse zone had already hit this
 * once and left the reason in a comment — a comment no other zone could be failed by.
 *
 * Playwright discourages `networkidle` for its own reasons. Here it is not a smell, it is a contradiction
 * with the architecture, so it is a gate: wait on the ELEMENT the test is about to act on, or assert the
 * effect of the action and retry (`expect(async () => {...}).toPass()`).
