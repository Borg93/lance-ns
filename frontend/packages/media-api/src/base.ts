 * the zone's base. The zones set it once at layout-module init (`setApiBase(base)` with
 * SvelteKit's `$app/paths` base); the default `''` keeps root-absolute `/api/*` for
 * unbased consumers (unit tests, the standalone dev servers before the layout runs).
 * Framework-agnostic on purpose — this package never imports `$app/*`.

 *  annotator are separate images, separate pods and separate dev servers, so a server process only
 *  ever sees one base. That invariant is invisible at the call site and would fail as wrong URLs on
 *  a shared SSR request path rather than as an error, so it is asserted instead of assumed —
