"""Runner bindings — how ratch's driver reaches a runner, knowing no models.

A ``Stage.runner=`` names a ``runners/<name>/`` directory, and that name is the
WHOLE coupling. Two conventions hang off it:

* **actor resolution** — :func:`resolve_runner_actor` imports
  ``runners.<name>.actor``, which must export ``compute_factory(ctx)`` (returns
  the per-batch callable; the model loads once per Ray actor) and
  ``OUTPUT_SCHEMA`` (the pyarrow schema of its rows). A new model is one runner
  dir + one ``Stage`` entry — the driver and composition root never change.
* **env attachment** — on a Ray cluster the driver attaches that runner's env to
  the stage's actors via a per-stage ``runtime_env`` (deps resolve on the
  WORKERS — the driver env stays model-free). On a local single-node run the
  actors share the driver env, so the ``[models]`` extra supplies the deps and
  no runtime_env is attached (isolation is opt-in via ``RATCH_RUNNER_ISOLATION=1``
  — pip-installing torch per local run would be waste).
