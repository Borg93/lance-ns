/**
 * Every zone mounts the run-notification bell, and every zone has a transport to feed it.
 *
 * `@repo/ui`'s `NotificationCenter` was built shared on purpose — the annotator had already forked the
 * estate header once and drifted — but sharing a component only guarantees that the zones which mount it
 * agree. Measured live, signed in as alice, against the deployed images:
 *
 *     bell in home: 0 · lakehouse: 1 · media: 0 · annotator: 0
 *
 * One zone out of four, and the wrong one: a person waiting on a batch is in the annotator or the media
 * zone doing the work that batch feeds, not on the run board where they would have to go to learn it
 * failed. Nothing failed, no test went red, and the component's own docstring said every zone got it.
 *
 * That is the exact shape of claim this package exists to gate, so this is the gate. Both halves are
 * required, because either alone is satisfiable by a broken zone: a mounted bell with no feed renders an
 * empty panel forever, and a feed nobody mounts is dead code.
