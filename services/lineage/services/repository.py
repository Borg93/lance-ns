"""Data-access layer for the lineage graph — all openCypher lives here.

The repository owns the two halves of the AGE graph: the **write** path (ingest an
OpenLineage run event → MERGE Run/Job/Dataset nodes + edges) and the **read** path
(traverse provenance / impact / producers). Endpoints depend on this class and never
see raw Cypher — per the layered architecture (handlers → repository → AGE).

Graph shape::

    (:Job {namespace, name})
    (:Run {run_id, author, event_type, event_time, producer, error_message})
    (:Dataset {name, namespace, source_uri, tags})  # name = catalog table id
    (:User {name})                            # an OIDC sub (the verified principal)
    (:Run)-[:OF_JOB]->(:Job)
    (:Run)-[:READ]->(:Dataset)                # inputs
    (:Run)-[:WROTE {version, schema}]->(:Dataset)  # outputs (version = Lance version; schema per version)
    (:Dataset)-[:DERIVED_FROM]->(:Dataset)    # output <- input (dataset lineage)
    (:User)-[:CREATED]->(:Dataset)            # who created the table (catalog create event)
    (:Column {dataset, field, namespace, type})    # a column; dataset = owning :Dataset.name (#24)
    (:Dataset)-[:HAS_COLUMN]->(:Column)            # the dataset's columns (complete typed inventory)
    (:Column)-[:DERIVED_FROM_COLUMN {...}]->(:Column)  # output_col <- input_col (field-to-field lineage)

A **successful** run (``COMPLETE``) asserts data: it gets a versioned ``WROTE`` edge plus
``DERIVED_FROM`` (and ``CREATED`` on a catalog create). A **failed** run (``FAIL``/``ABORT``)
is still recorded — its ``Run`` carries the ``error_message`` and it keeps a ``WROTE`` edge so
``producers()`` surfaces the attempt — but with **no version** and **no ``DERIVED_FROM``**: a
failed run produced no data, so it must not assert lineage.

Datasets are MERGEd on ``{name}`` only (then ``namespace`` / ``source_uri`` / ``tags`` are SET)
so a dataset referenced by several runs is never duplicated.
