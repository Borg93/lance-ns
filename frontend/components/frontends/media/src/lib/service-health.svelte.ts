/**
 * Live service health, polled once for the whole zone.
 *
 * The backend already tells us which encoders are reachable — `/api/health` reports `embed.ok` and
 * `rerank.ok`. Nothing was reading it except the sidebar's status dot, so the search bar happily offered
 * Meaning and Hybrid modes on a deployment where neither can run: measured 2026-07-26 through the ingress,
 * `mode=fts` → 200 with rows, `mode=semantic` and `mode=hybrid` → 503 "embed …", because the viewer's
 * `embed_url` still defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8001` (lance-media's sidecar-era default) and the chart
 * never re-pointed it. A user picked a mode, got a failure toast, and learned nothing about why. The one
 * signal was a red dot in a corner — permanently red, so ignorable.
 *
 * Driven by HEALTH rather than a build-time flag on purpose: the moment an encoder is deployed and
 * `embed.ok` flips true, the modes light up on the next poll with nothing to remember to change. A flag
 * would have to be found and flipped by whoever deploys the encoder, which is how a capability stays
 * hidden after it starts working.
 *
 * One store, one poll: the sidebar badge and the mode selector read the same object, so they cannot
 * disagree about whether search works — two independent fetches would eventually show a green dot beside a
 * disabled mode.

	 *  the first reading has not landed yet when it returns.
	 *
