# Open work — the backlog that must survive the merge

This file exists because the open items were only ever recorded as **session task IDs** (`#103`, `#124`, …)
in a task tracker that does not outlive the session, and in a re-pin diff that was applied and deleted by
design. After the merge nobody in rask knows what "#103" means.

So every entry below is **self-describing**: what it is, why it is open, where the code lives, and what
would close it. The old task numbers are kept only as a cross-reference for anyone reading the lance-ns
history. **`docs/architecture/lance-ns-merge.md` P0 copies this file into rask** — it is not left behind,
and P8 reconciles it rather than dropping it.

Status as of 2026-07-27. The twenty UX-goal conditions are met — the goal tracker is retired (git
history); **the durable artifact is [`GOAL-UX-REACTIVE-EVIDENCE.md`](GOAL-UX-REACTIVE-EVIDENCE.md)**.
Everything here is what remains *after* that.

---

## A. The merge forces this one

### A1 · The media corpus must leave its node hostPath *(was #103)*

**What.** `services/{viewer,search,annotator}` read the corpus from a node-local `hostPath`
(`/var/media-corpus`, `chart/templates/media.yaml:126`), staged from the lance-audio box. `MEDIA_DB_ROOT`,
`MEDIA_DB` and `MEDIA_DESCRIPTOR_DIR` all hang off `media.corpusMountPath`; 10+ files across the three
services read it.

**Why it is open.** It was correct for a single-node kind cluster and deliberately deferred — "NO data move:
the corpus stays node-local", per the template's own comment.

**Why the merge forces it.** A hostPath binds a pod to whichever node holds the data. The merge plan's P4
already rules **"no hostPath ships"**.

**What closes it.** Two halves, and they should be decided separately:
- *Portable:* register the corpus as **catalog-governed project tables** (the intended read-plane shape).
  This survives any destination and is the part worth doing first.
- *Destination-specific:* a PVC, or a rustfs-backed corpus bucket on rask's operator Tenant. Decide this in
  P4 against the cluster it will actually live on — deciding it in lance-ns means deciding it twice.

## B. Built halfway — the second half is named and small

### B1 · No actor type and no workflow are registered *(was #124, second half)*

**What is done.** `lance-statestore` is live: `state.postgresql` on the AGE Postgres, DSN resolved from
OpenBao through `lance-secrets`, `actorStateStore: "true"`, scoped to `catalog` + `annotator`. Per-subject
user state round-trips through it and is proven across browser contexts.

**What is not.** The flag that gates actors *and* workflow is on and **nothing uses it**. No actor type is
registered; no workflow is registered.

**What closes it.** An actor type hosted by a service in the component's `scopes`, proven by a round trip
through the sidecar. Keep `tests/unit/test_invariants.py`'s scope check — an app missing from `scopes` gets
"component not found" and every user's saved work 503s, logged by the sidecar and noticed by nothing else.

### B2 · The notification inbox has no actor *(was #128)*

**What.** Read/dismissed state for notifications is per-tab. The bell itself is done and estate-wide (all
four zones, shared `@repo/api/runs-feed`), because `GET /runs` already carries the lifecycle — but *read*
and *dismissed* are per-subject state the run feed cannot carry.

**Why it is open.** It needs B1.

**What closes it.** One actor per subject inbox, unread counts that cannot race, expiry via reminders rather
than a sweeper cron.

### B2b · ratch's runner imports become the Ray-native name seam *(new, 2026-07-27)*

**What.** `packages/ratch/cli/{speaker,transcribe}.py` still lazily import `from runners.diarize.diarize
import …` — repo-relative module paths from the lance-audio heritage, working only when the repo root is on
`sys.path`. The runners tree deliberately carries no `__init__.py` glue any more (`a4cf8f6`) and runners are
sealed non-members of the workspace, so these imports are dead code walking.

**What closes it.** When ratch is wired (the pipeline step): ratch passes runner NAMES and each runner's
`pyproject.toml` as the Ray worker `runtime_env`; the actor module imports on the WORKER. The contract is
stated in `runners/README.md`. Do not resolve this by making `runners.` importable again.

### B3 · Annotation projects are designed, not built *(was #122)*

**What.** `docs/DESIGN-annotation-projects.md` — entities, both state machines, the authz doors, what a
publish emits, and a slice plan.

**Where it stands.** Slices `S1`–`S4` (domain core, FGA type, publish schema, catalog `create` pin) need no
store and are the next buildable unit. `S5`–`S10` need B1's actors.

---

## C. Carrying a stated reason

### C1 · `TableDetail`'s 60-assignment reset effect *(was #119)*

**What.** `TableDetail.svelte` resets ~60 assignments in an `$effect` where `{#key table}` would do it
structurally.

**Why it is still open, with evidence.** The fix re-instantiates a 1000-line component under 215 e2e tests.
This is not caution for its own sake: an edit to that component during this session **dropped 6 of its 10
history versions** (`missing: 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3`) with `svelte-check` reporting 0 errors and 0 warnings. It
is a component that punishes casual edits and needs its own pass with a browser drive, not a tidy-up.

### C2 · The product-works pass *(was #97)*

Ten conditions — annotator loop, runners, one-nav, FGA workbench, create-project, preview, lineage facets,
drawers, registry, gates. Orthogonal to the merge. Its premise is the one worth keeping: *drive the product
as a skeptical first user, not the elements.*

### C3 · Lineage track remainder *(was #111)*

Spec-fidelity and Marquez-parity reports are done; Dapr-delivery and gold-finding tests landed in `b43b8ff`.
**What remains is the gold whole-history JSONB embed** — and note it is the *same artifact* as the merge
plan's **P7b gold schema contract**. Do it once, there.

### C4 · Prod-readiness residuals *(was #86)*

Residuals from the retired `GOAL-production-readiness` tracker. Re-derive against the merged chart rather
than the lance-ns one — several will have been answered by rask's operators.

## D. Owner-deferred — not work, decisions already made

| Item | Ruling |
| --- | --- |
| **Settings surface** *(was #112)* — break out auth / authz / audit | Owner: *"keep it as is"* |
| **NATS HA / nack operator + GitOps; query engine** *(was #20)* | Owner-parked. The merge plan's PROPOSED decision 5 holds it parked too, noting rask's JetStream is on but streamless and lance-ns's stream-job is its first real consumer |
| **Models registry MLflow parity** *(was #101)* | Deprioritized until after the product pass |
| **Annotator residuals** *(was #100)* — export serializers (COCO / YOLO / CSV / HF) + managed label taxonomy | Owner to schedule. ⚠️ **The export half is the same service as the merge plan's P7c `exporter`** (ALTO 4.4 first, owner-ruled R4: serialization is a separate microservice, never inside the lakehouse or the movers). COCO/YOLO/CSV/HF become additional projections from gold — new functions in that service, not a second export path. Do not build these twice |
| **Storybook** | Struck for now — rask keeps its own (plan P2 step 3); adopt rask's rather than re-deciding |
| `/lakehouse/data` scaffold, `/lakehouse/admin` orphan | Product decisions, not defects with one right answer |

## How this survives

1. **P0** of `docs/architecture/lance-ns-merge.md` copies this file to `rask/docs/OPEN-WORK.md`.
2. **P8** reconciles it — items closed *by* the merge get struck with the evidence; the rest carry forward
   into rask's own tracking, renumbered or not, but never silently dropped.
3. `MERGE-REPIN-DELTA.md` was a diff, was applied (the plan is re-pinned, rulings R8–R10 + D7 recorded),
   and was deleted as its own instructions required — git history keeps it. **This file is not deletable**;
   it is reconciled at P8, never dropped.
