/**
 * The lakehouse zone hosts four areas — catalog (`data`), `lineage`, `models` and `admin` — that used
 * to be four separate SvelteKit apps. They were split by URL prefix but not by domain: all four read
 * the SAME catalog + lineage planes through the same client, the top navbar already presented them as
 * one "Lakehouse" surface, and three of them carried byte-identical copies of the lineage client. The
 * split cost four SSR servers, four copies of the shell in four bundles, and a full document reload on
 * every hop between them, and bought nothing — every zone shipped from one image tag anyway.
 *
 * Merged, a hop between areas is a SOFT navigation. What the sidebar must still do is show only the
 * CURRENT area's routes, so this resolves the area from the path — the same two-level routing split as
 * before (the shell owns the namespace boundary, the area owns its interior), except now both levels
 * live in one router.
