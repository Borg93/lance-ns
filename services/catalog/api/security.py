"""OIDC authentication dependency.

When OIDC is disabled (the default) this is a no-op and all routes stay open.
When enabled, it requires a valid bearer token on every route it guards and maps
auth failures to ``UnauthenticatedError`` (rendered as RFC 9457 problem+json, 401).

Fail-closed invariant: if OIDC is enabled in settings but the verifier was never
wired onto ``app.state`` (e.g. discovery failed at startup, or a deployment skew),
we raise ``ServiceUnavailableError`` (503) rather than silently letting requests
through. A configured-but-broken auth layer must never degrade to open access.
