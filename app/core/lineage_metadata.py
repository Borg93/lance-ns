"""Embed lineage coordinates *into the Lance file itself* at table creation (#21).

The catalog already links a table to its lineage by a convention — the canonical id is the lineage
``Dataset`` name and the ``WROTE`` edge carries the Lance version. But nothing is written *into the
data*, so a copied/moved Lance dataset loses its lineage coordinates. Here we stamp those coordinates
onto the Arrow **schema metadata** of the create payload, so the Lance file is **self-describing**:
``lineage.dataset_id`` / ``lineage.namespace`` / ``lineage.create_run_id`` / ``lineage.created_by`` can
be read straight off the table and reconciled to the lineage graph without the catalog.

``create_run_id`` is the *same* run id the catalog emits in the OpenLineage create event, so the file
points at its exact creating run in the graph — and the **creator stays recoverable** from that run via
the lineage service's FGA-gated ``/creator`` endpoint. We deliberately do **not** stamp the creator's
OIDC ``sub`` into the file: it is identity/PII and the Lance file lives on object storage *outside* the
OpenFGA boundary, so embedding it would leak the principal to anyone with raw bucket access. (#22 audit)
