 * The whole body is `@repo/api/runs-feed`, shared with every other zone — probe the lineage cursor,
 * re-read `/runs` when it moves, failures first, trim to the window, keep the stream alive. What cannot be
 * shared is exactly this file: `query.live` must be declared inside an app to get its own endpoint, and
 * `getRequestEvent` only exists there. So a zone's cost of having the bell is four lines, which is why it
 * had no business shipping in one zone out of four.
