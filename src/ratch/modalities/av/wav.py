"""ffmpeg WAV transcode — pure compute, shared by the speech runners.

Model-free by definition (an external transcoder, no inference), so it lives in
``modalities/av`` with the other ffmpeg helpers (frames, thumbnails) rather than
in any runner: diarize and voiceprint both feed their models 16 kHz mono WAV,
and the transcode is the stage-side preparation of the media, not the model.
(The viewer keeps its own copy in ``services/viewer/services/wespeaker.py`` on
purpose — the backend never imports the pipeline package.)
