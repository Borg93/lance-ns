"""Table-maintenance policy registry (#50) — the catalog↔compaction contract, so it lives in common
(the same reasoning as the outbox: one service writes the records, another enforces them, and a
per-service copy of the format would drift).

Stateless-over-object-store, the same shape as the warehouse registry: each policy is one JSON record
under ``<control_root>/_policies/``, written by the catalog (owner-gated) and read directly off the
bucket by the compaction service on every sweep tick (it has no catalog client by design). A record
carries the *logical* id it was set for plus the *physical* bucket-qualified path (``<bucket>/<path>``
— the sweep spans per-warehouse and multi-base buckets, so a bucket-relative path would let a policy
govern a same-named path in another tenant's bucket), so the two services never need a shared resolver:

* table policy — ``path`` is the dataset directory (resolved from ``describe_table`` at set time);
* namespace policy — ``path`` is the namespace directory prefix, and the id doubles as a logical
  parent-chain match for the catalog's flat ``<uuid>_<table_id>`` layout (see :func:`resolve_policy`);
* project policy (#84) — the tenant-wide default: no ``path``, instead ``buckets`` (the project's
  active warehouse buckets, resolved from the warehouse registry at set time), matched at the bucket
  level so it also covers medallion-nested datasets that carry no logical id.

Resolution order (:func:`resolve_policy`): a table policy wins over a namespace policy wins over a
project policy wins over the sweep's global defaults.

Trust boundary: like the warehouse registry, records are trusted as written — the write path is the
catalog's owner-gated API, and a principal with direct write access to the control bucket is already
inside the storage trust boundary. Known limitation: dropping or renaming a table does not clean up
its policy record; the orphan matches nothing (the path is gone) but lingers until deleted.

Fields: ``retention_days`` / ``retain_versions`` (old-version cleanup overrides — Lance itself exempts
tag-pinned versions from cleanup, so ``blessed`` and friends survive any policy), ``compact_enabled``
(opt a dataset out of maintenance entirely), ``compact_interval_hours`` (cadence — the sweep skips the
dataset until the interval has elapsed since its last maintenance; the sweep records that stamp under
``_policies/state/``, a separate prefix so the two writers never contend). All IO is blocking; callers
threadpool it.

    Record paths are bucket-qualified (``<bucket>/<path>``) — the sweep spans multiple buckets
    (per-warehouse, multi-base), and a bucket-relative path would let a policy in one bucket govern a
    same-named path in another tenant's bucket.

    A namespace record matches two ways, because the catalog's physical layout is *flat*: a table
    ``db$users`` lives at ``<bucket>/<uuid>_db$users``, never under a ``db/`` directory, so a directory
    prefix alone would make namespace policies dead letters for every catalog-created table (audit
    2026-07-16). The caller therefore also passes the dataset's ``logical_id`` (from the ``<uuid>_``
    layout) and the record matches when its id is on the logical parent chain. The directory-prefix
    match stays for nested layouts (the medallion zones), where there is no logical id to derive.

    A project record (#84) matches when the dataset's BUCKET is in the record's ``buckets`` — the
    bucket-level match needs no logical id, so it also covers a project bucket's medallion-nested
    datasets. It is strictly the LAST fallback: any table or namespace match shadows it. A bucket
    belongs to one project, so DISTINCT project records both claiming the dataset's bucket are a
    registry misconfiguration (a possible cross-tenant claim): the tier then resolves to NO match
    with a warning — never first-encountered-wins, which would let record ordering decide whose
    retention policy destroys whose version history (audit 2026-07-23).
