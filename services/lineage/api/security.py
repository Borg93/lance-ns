"""OIDC authentication dependency for the lineage read + ingest endpoints.

When OIDC is disabled (the default) this is a no-op and all routes stay open. When
enabled, it requires a verified bearer token and maps auth failures to RFC 9457
problem+json (401). It binds to ``LineageSettings`` but otherwise mirrors the catalog's
``services/catalog/api/security.py`` and reuses the catalog's :class:`~common.oidc.OIDCVerifier` — so
token verification has one source of truth.

Fail-closed invariant: if OIDC is enabled in settings but the verifier was never wired
onto ``app.state`` (startup/discovery skew), we raise ``ServiceUnavailableError`` (503)
rather than silently letting requests through.

    reach lineage over the Dapr subscription route, which is guarded by the app-api-token and attributes
    the run to the producer-stamped author (``lineage/api/dapr.py``). OIDC is the *human/external* door.
    The Ray TRAIN job is an internal producer that simply has no sidecar (docs/RAY-TRAIN.md D2), so it
    POSTs the HTTP ingest — where, before this, it hit the OIDC wall and **every training RunEvent 401'd,
    silently losing all training provenance in a governed deployment** (live 2026-07-13).

    Minting a Dex user for it would introduce exactly the "second identity axis the lineage graph must
    bridge" that D3 argues against. So a service authenticates with the app token it already shares, and
    NAMES itself with the same bare FGA subject the rest of the estate uses (``service-trainer``) — the
    identity D5 already grants (``writer`` on ``namespace:models`` only).

    The claimed subject is **allowlisted** (``LINEAGE_SERVICE_SUBJECTS``): a token holder can only speak
    as a configured service, never as a human — so this cannot become an impersonation primitive. And it
    is *stricter* than the Dapr route it mirrors: the outputs are still FGA-checked as that subject, so a
    trainer can only record provenance for what its rung lets it write.
