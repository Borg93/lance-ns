 *
 * `RunStatusLike` is the structural shape of the lineage service's `RunStatus`
 * (`services/lineage/schemas.py`, served by `GET /runs` and generated into
 * `@repo/api/lineage`). It is spelled out here rather than imported because `@repo/ui` must not
 * depend on the app API package — the shared library never owns a client, and a zone hands it
 * data. `tests/run-status.test.ts` pins every field name against the committed
 * `docs/lineage-openapi.json`, so a backend rename fails a test here instead of rendering blanks.
 *
 * The helpers are pure so the notification surface can be reasoned about (and tested) without a
 * DOM: which runs are unread, what a run's phase is, how far along it is.
