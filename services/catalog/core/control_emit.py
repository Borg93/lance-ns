"""Best-effort control-plane change-event emission from the catalog onto the Dapr/NATS bus.

Mirrors `core/lineage_emit.py`'s Dapr transport, for the governance/metadata stream (grants, warehouses,
policies, namespaces, tables) instead of the OpenLineage data stream. Publish is **inline-awaited +
best-effort**: the mutation endpoints `await` it AFTER the backend/FGA mutation succeeds (so a real change
is never announced), but it swallows every error, so the bus being down/slow can never fail a catalog
mutation — the audit trail still records it, we just skip the live-refresh hint (fail-open, the
`lineage_emit` principle). No broker client in app code: we publish to the local Dapr sidecar via
`common.dapr_publish.publish_event` (the sidecar owns retry/backoff/DLQ as component config); the catalog
subscribes to the same topic WITHOUT a queueGroupName, so every replica gets every event (broadcast).
