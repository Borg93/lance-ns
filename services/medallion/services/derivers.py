"""Content-dispatched artifact derivation — how the cascade is multimodal WITHOUT the platform knowing.

The lakehouse operates on LANCE TYPES only: tabular columns flow as tabular, vector columns as vectors,
and a blob column is bytes of ANY media kind (image, audio, video, docs — ``lance_docs/guide.md`` blob
chapter). The generic compute carries all of them forward; this module is the single place that decides
what a stage can DERIVE from blob payloads, by probing the CONTENT (not config, not column names, not
dataset names):

* image payloads → the inline artifacts (``thumbnail`` PNG + ``embedding`` fixed-size floats)
* anything unrecognised → carried forward untouched (an audio deriver slots into ``_DERIVERS`` later)
* no blob columns at all (tabular datasets) → a no-op

So EVERY stage of EVERY lane runs the same transform and "just works" per dataset content — no
per-mover media config, no modality branches in the platform.
