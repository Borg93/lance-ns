"""``GET /v1/projects`` — first-class tenant enumeration, DERIVED from the warehouse registry (no new DB).

A *project* is the FGA model's tenant type (``services/common/auth/model.fga``): warehouses hang off it via
their ``project`` field, and every grant cascades down from it. The estate never stores a project record —
a project EXISTS exactly when a warehouse record claims it — so these endpoints derive the tenant list by
grouping the warehouse registry (``catalog.services.warehouses.list_warehouses``, which already skips a
corrupt/unreadable record with a warning rather than voiding the listing; the grouping here extends that
per-record tolerance to records missing their ``project``/``id`` fields). Creation stays IMPLICIT via
warehouse-create by design: ``POST /v1/warehouses`` (gated on ``project#can_create_warehouse``) is the one
door that mints a tenant, so there is no project-create endpoint to drift from the registry truth.

**Estate-observer gated.** Both routes check ``can_observe_events`` on the fixed root object
(``settings.fga_root_object``) — the estate-OBSERVER action: it gates the estate-wide reads (the
``/v1/events`` feed AND this tenant enumeration), because listing every tenant's name, buckets and admins
is the same whole-estate disclosure as watching every tenant's governance changes. A mere project admin
gets a 403 (authorization scope == data scope, the ``/v1/events`` #12 rationale). ``/v1/projects`` matches
no resource prefix in ``fga_deps.authorize``, so the router-wide gate only sets the 401/503 floor; the
decision is made here explicitly via ``fga_deps.require_relation`` (audited allow/deny/outage, #41).

``admins`` comes from OpenFGA ``list_users`` (the #51 access-review primitive) on
``project:<id>#can_administer`` — EFFECTIVE admins (role assignees, team members, the cascade), not raw
tuples. It degrades to ``[]`` when FGA is off or unavailable (the registry-derived facts still serve;
an authz-lookup outage must not 500 the tenant list — the gate above already failed closed for callers).
