"""Durable object-store outbox for lineage events (#4) — closes the commit→publish loss window.

Today a producer commits its Lance write and then does a FIRE-AND-FORGET Dapr publish (the sidecar accepts
the RPC but there is no broker/consumer ack). A crash between the commit and a durable delivery loses the
lineage event: the data landed but the graph never learns of it. The DLQ only catches events that were
published *then* failed delivery; the reconcile back-fill only recovers version+schema, not the full event.

The outbox closes it: the producer stages the FULL ``RunEvent`` JSON as an object under
``<outbox_uri>/<run_id>.json`` BEFORE the publish, and deletes it once the publish returns. Because the
stage happens AFTER the commit, every surviving object corresponds to a real committed write (no phantoms).
If the process crashes before the delete — or the publish never lands — the object survives and the lineage
service's reconcile relay re-ingests it (idempotent on ``run_id``) and deletes it. Strictly richer than the
version+schema back-fill: inputs, author, and columnLineage are all preserved.

Storage-agnostic: an ``s3://`` outbox uses an ``S3FileSystem`` built from the SAME ``storage_options`` the
producer/relay already use; a local/``file://`` path uses the local filesystem (dev + unit tests).
