"""OpenLineage emission for ratch stages — DRAFT (spec 2-0-2), opt-in and inert.

Status: a first cut, NOT wired into the driver yet. It builds the pieces a stage
run must contribute to lance-ns's lineage graph, mirroring their emit contract so
it drops in at merge:

    lance-ns mover (services/medallion): transform_stage → WriteResult
        (version, row_count, size_bytes, fields, column_map) → build_run_event → publish

Here we produce the SAME `WriteResult` from a stage we wrote, plus the
`column_map` (field→field edges) DECLARED from our `Stage` model — the input the
harness turns into the `columnLineage` facet.

The facet primitives (`WriteResult`, `facet_fields`, `build_run_event`, the spec
constants) are KERNEL-owned (`common.lancekit.openlineage`, re-exported here for
the pipeline's callers); this module adds only the `Stage`-aware layer.

Two modes, one seam (`emit_stage_lineage`):
  * MERGED  — pass lance-ns's own `build_run_event` (import
    `medallion.schemas.events.build_run_event`) as `builder=`; we supply the
    measured `WriteResult` + `column_map`, they own the wire event. This is the
    intended end-state — do NOT reimplement their emitter in production.
  * STANDALONE — `builder=None` uses the kernel's `build_run_event`, a minimal
    spec-2-0-2 mirror, so a pre-merge Ray/CLI run can emit real events to a
    `LineageSink` (file/stdout/HTTP).

Nothing here imports a model client or Ray; it's pure over a written dataset path
+ the `Stage` declaration, so it's callable from the driver, a test, or a backfill.
