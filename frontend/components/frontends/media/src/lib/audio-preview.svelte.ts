/**
 * Shared one-element audio preview for result rows/cards — "listen to this
 * chunk" without loading it into the player pane.
 *
 * ONE HTMLAudioElement lives here (created lazily on the first play, i.e.
 * inside a user gesture), so starting any clip pauses whatever else was
 * playing — previews can never overlap, and the play/pause buttons all read
 * one source of truth (`playing`, keyed by utils.hitKey). The source is the
 * same range-streamed endpoint the player uses (api.mediaUrl) plus a media
 * fragment `#t=start,end`, so the browser range-requests straight to the
 * chunk; engines that ignore the END fragment are stopped by the timeupdate
 * guard below. Mirrors the `voiceSearch` singleton pattern.
