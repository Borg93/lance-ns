"""The fake-Ray in-process Lance compute for the medallion cascade (the lance-ray seam, #25 / P1 #6).

Default OFF (``MEDALLION_COMPUTE_ENABLED``): the movers/producer stay dummy-emitters (lineage, no data).
When on, each stage does a **real** Lance write — the producer seeds ``raw_events``; each mover reads its
upstream Lance dataset, applies a stage transform, and writes the downstream one — so the emitted lineage
carries the **real** Lance version and the whole event-driven loop produces actual versioned data, not just
provenance.

This is the **same** ``read → transform → write → version`` contract a distributed Ray Data job
(``lance-ray`` on rask's KubeRay) fills in production; here it runs **in-process** so the cascade is
end-to-end testable without a Ray cluster. The compute operates on LANCE TYPES only: every stage carries
rows forward — tabular columns as tabular, vectors as vectors, blob columns of any media kind
re-materialised safely — and stamps a ``stage`` provenance column; what a stage derives from blob
payloads is dispatched on CONTENT by :mod:`medallion.services.derivers` (image → thumbnail+embedding;
unrecognised → untouched; tabular → no-op), so the same deployed mover binary serves every lane with
zero media config. Heavier per-stage ML (real encoders, captioning) is the distributed job's job at
rask. Blocking Lance/S3 IO; callers run it in the threadpool.
