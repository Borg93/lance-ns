/**
 * The run-notification pulse, shared by every zone.
 *
 * `@repo/ui`'s `NotificationCenter` was written so that "every zone gets the SAME one" — the annotator had
 * already forked the header once and drifted. But the *transport* stayed in the lakehouse zone, so the bell
 * shipped in one zone out of four. Measured live, signed in as alice:
 *
 *     bell in home: 0 · lakehouse: 1 · media: 0 · annotator: 0
 *
 * Which is the wrong one to have. A person waiting on a batch is most likely to be in the annotator or the
 * media zone, doing the work the batch feeds — not on the run board, which is where they would have to go
 * to find out it failed. The component being shared was never the point; being *mounted* is.
 *
 * The generator lives here rather than in each zone because it is entirely generic: probe the lineage
 * cursor, re-read `/runs` when it moves, sort failures first, trim to the window, keep the stream alive.
 * What is NOT generic is the SvelteKit binding — `query.live` must be declared inside each app to get its
 * own endpoint, and `getRequestEvent` only exists there. So each zone owns a four-line `.remote.ts` that
 * hands this its `fetch` and its credential, and nothing else is duplicated.

/**
 * The lineage pulse generator: one stream carrying both the cursor and the notification runs, because a
 * zone needs exactly these two things and needs them to agree.
 *
 * It was two live queries at first: a cursor for the panels and a run feed for the shell's bell. Both are
 * mounted on every page (the bell lives in the root layout), so every page held two long-lived streams to
 * the same origin, each polling the same `/events` probe on its own clock — measured at ~30 probes/second
 * against the e2e suite. Merging them halves that and removes a subtler problem for free: with separate
 * cursors the bell and the table under it could be a poll apart on the same estate.
 *
 * FAIL QUIET. A probe that 401s, 403s, times out or cannot connect does NOT throw and does not end the
 * stream — it simply does not tick. Every consuming panel already renders its own honest sign-in / denied /
 * offline state from its own read's status; a cursor that threw would replace that with a boundary error.
 *
 * KEEPALIVE. A change-only stream is by definition silent on an idle estate, and both the edge
 * (`proxy-read-timeout`) and the zone's own Bun server (`IDLE_TIMEOUT`) sever an idle stream. So the last
 * pulse is re-sent every {@link KEEPALIVE_MS}: the bytes keep the stream alive, and because `cursor` is
 * then an unchanged number, no consumer's `$effect` re-runs on it.
