"""Storage-version reconciliation endpoint (#23) — does the graph agree with the on-disk Lance file?

Our moat over format-unaware catalogs (Marquez, Lakekeeper): because we own a Lance lakehouse we read
the real on-disk version and cross-check it against the version the graph recorded on the ``WROTE`` edge.
Gated on ``can_get_metadata`` for ``{name}`` (router-level); the blocking Lance read runs in the
threadpool so the object-store I/O never stalls the event loop.
