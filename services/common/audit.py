"""Structured compliance audit trail — a dedicated audit-event stream, separate from operational logs.

Every security-relevant action (authn success/failure, authz allow/deny, credential vending, admin ops)
is emitted as one structured event on the ``lance.audit`` logger: who (subject), what (action), the resource,
the outcome, and when (the record timestamp). A dedicated logger name keeps audit records a single,
filterable stream — routable and retainable independently of the noisy app INFO tier — and they export via
OTLP to GreptimeDB like every other log, queryable by ``audit.action`` / ``audit.outcome`` / ``audit.subject``
(the dedicated ``lance.audit`` logger name).

The whole trail is gated by one flag (:func:`configure_audit`, from a service's ``LANCE_AUDIT_ENABLED``
setting): a deployment turns audit on or off for its compliance posture by setting the dedicated logger's
level. Fields are consistent across every call site, so a record never misses who / what / outcome.
