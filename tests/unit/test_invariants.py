"""CLAIM-LINT — the mechanical guards for the bug class that kept escaping this repo (GOAL-prove-it P0.2).

Three real, shipped bugs motivated each guard below. Every one passed the entire unit + integration suite
and a manual "live-verified" run, because a prose CLAIM was never mechanically checked:

  1. "#4: every lineage publish is staged through the outbox" — THREE publishers bypassed it (the media
     head + two FAIL emits, one on a _DROP path where a lost publish erased the failure forever). I had
     verified the ONE publisher I changed and never grepped for the rest.
  2. "MEDALLION_LINEAGE_OUTBOX_URI is wired" — the chart injected it and no code ever read it (a dead env).
     A whole feature was configured and inert.
  3. "seed_warehouse grants the FGA parent edge" — it wrote `warehouse#parent`, a relation the warehouse
     type does NOT define (its pointer is `project`). OpenFGA rejected the write → a live 503, while every
     unit test stayed green because mocked `fga.check`/`write_tuples` pin the STRING, never the SCHEMA.

The rule these encode: a claim that cannot be proven by a grep, a test, or a render is not a claim — it is
a guess. Each test below fails on the ORIGINAL buggy code and passes now.
