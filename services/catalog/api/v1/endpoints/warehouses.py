"""Admin control-plane endpoints: warehouse provisioning + warehouse-scoped namespaces (#3-A).

A *warehouse* = one physically separate S3 bucket owned by a project (the FGA model's catalog-root type).
These routes are the **control plane** the catalog lacked: an authorized project-admin provisions a bucket
at RUNTIME (not the static Helm `mc mb` loop) and creates namespaces bound to it, so tables under those
namespaces land in that warehouse's bucket — physically isolated from every other tenant's. Lakekeeper
parity for multi-tenancy; the routing itself (an unbound namespace → the shared default root) stays
backward-compatible.

Authorization is DELIBERATELY stronger than the data plane: warehouse-create gates on the project's
`can_create_warehouse` (= admin) — the model action that until now was defined but never enforced — not the
writer-tier create-on-parent that guards tables/namespaces.
