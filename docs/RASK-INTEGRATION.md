# Merging the lakehouse into rask — integration checklist

This repo's deliverable is **contributed into the sibling `rask/` repo**, not shipped standalone. This is the
concrete migration plan: what folds in, what externalizes to rask's operators, the lance-ray seam contract,
and what to drop. Grounded in rask's actual chart (`rask/chart/`) + this repo's services + chart.

## The boundary (what moves vs what rask supplies)

**We bring (the unit that merges):**
- The **lakehouse catalog** (`services/catalog`, a thin REST adapter over native pylance `DirectoryNamespace`) + the in-process `dataplane`.
- The **lineage estate** (`services/lineage` → Apache AGE graph; OpenLineage; `/reconcile`; column-level + the gold whole-history JSONB). **rask has ZERO lineage** — this is the single biggest net-new capability we add.
- The **OpenFGA WIRING** (`services/common/auth/model.fga` + `services/catalog/api/fga_deps.py` + credential vending). **rask provisions OpenFGA but never wires it into any service** — we bring the actual ReBAC enforcement.
- The **event-driven medallion estate** (`services/medallion` producer + movers, `services/compaction`) on Dapr pub/sub over NATS JetStream.

**rask supplies (use, do NOT rebuild):**
- **CloudNativePG** — the Postgres `Cluster` (`<release>-postgres`).
- **rustfs-operator** — the S3 `Tenant` (`<release>-rustfs`, with a `buckets:` list).
- **KubeRay + Kueue** — the Ray cluster (`RayService`) + job admission, and the `ray-kit` / orchestrator submission path.
- **Traefik Ingress** + the **Alembic migration Job** + **GreptimeDB/Vector/Perses** observability + **NATS** + **Dapr**.
- ⚠️ **NOT the frontend, any more.** This line used to read "Frontends (SvelteKit microfrontends)", which
  contradicted §5 in the same document. `apps/web` was retired in the P5 migration and **the four zones ARE
  the frontend** — home / lakehouse / media / annotator, in rask's exact Turborepo shape. They graft into
  `rask/components/frontends/`; nothing of ours is dropped here. See §5.

## Pre-flight (rask already has these — no action)
NATS, Dapr, OpenFGA (server), CloudNativePG, rustfs-operator, KubeRay, Kueue, GreptimeDB stack, Traefik. The
chart pattern is identical (umbrella + `*.enabled` subcharts + externalize-in-prod), so the fold-in is values
+ templates, not a new paradigm. Which of these operators we lean on first, in what order, and why no custom
lance-ns operator is ever built: [`OPERATORS.md`](OPERATORS.md) (also pins the submit-seam boundary — the
agnostic Jobs-REST seam stays in lance-ns; rask supplies the `RayJob`-CR transport behind the same
function signatures).

## Migration checklist

### 1. Stateful stores → rask's operators (via the P1 externalization hooks)
The externalization hooks added in this repo make this a **values flip**, not a code change:

| lance-ns value | Set to | Points at rask's |
|---|---|---|
| `rustfs.enabled` | `false` | — (drop the hand-rolled Deployment) |
| `rustfs.externalEndpoint` | `http://<release>-rustfs:<port>` | rustfs-operator `Tenant` |
| `age.enabled` | `false` | — (drop the hand-rolled StatefulSet) |
| `age.externalHost` | `<release>-postgres-rw` | CNPG `Cluster` (rw service) |
| `openfga.datastore.uri` | `postgres://…@<release>-postgres-rw:5432/openfga…` | CNPG |
| `observability.externalOtlpEndpoint` | rask's GreptimeDB OTLP | shared observability |
| `stateStore.*` (**new**) | DSN → `<release>-postgres-rw` via the Dapr secret store | CNPG |

⚠️ **The state store did not exist when this table was written.** `lance-statestore` is a Dapr
`state.postgresql` component with `actorStateStore: "true"`, pointed at the AGE Postgres today and resolving
its DSN from OpenBao through `lance-secrets` — never a k8s Secret. On rask it moves to CNPG like the rest,
and its `scopes` must list every app that owns operational state (today: catalog, annotator). An app outside
`scopes` gets "component not found" from its sidecar and every user's saved work 503s, which the sidecar logs
and nothing else notices — `tests/unit/test_invariants.py` pins the agreement.

- **Add the buckets** to rask's `rustfs.buckets`: the lakehouse (`lance-catalog`) + observability (`lance-observability`).
- **Add the databases** to CNPG: `lineage` + `openfga`. **AGE caveat — DECIDED and proven, 2026-07.** AGE reached PG18 (v1.7.0), so it mounts as a CNPG
  **ImageVolume extension on a STOCK image** — option (a) without a custom Postgres build. Proven end to end
  on a throwaway kind cluster with the real CNPG operator (`docs/CNPG-AGE.md`, `.docker/cnpg-age-ext.dockerfile`).
  The CSI-mount leg needs K8s 1.33+. No Lance-native-graph rewrite is required.

### 2. lance-ray → a real Ray Data job (the one in-scope gap)
Today `services/medallion/producer.py` + the movers are **dummy Ray jobs** — pure lineage emitters by
default, but with `medallion.compute=true` (the B1 toggle) each stage does a real in-process Lance
read→transform→write, so the cascade already produces versioned data, not just provenance. On rask
they become **real Ray Data jobs on KubeRay** (Kueue-admitted, `ray-kit`/orchestrator-submitted). The seam
contract they must honor (so they drop in with no rewiring) — see **§ lance-ray seam contract** below.

### 3. Wire OpenFGA into rask
rask provisions OpenFGA but doesn't enforce it. Contribute `model.fga` + `fga_deps` so rask's services check
ReBAC (and so the medallion `can_promote`/`can_create_table` gates fire). This also gives rask its first authz.

### 4. Secrets — align the two-tier model
Map this repo's OpenBao + external-secrets two-tier model onto rask's secret approach (rask uses
`existingSecret` for prod). Keep: app tier consumes via Dapr secret store (sole source); infra tier via
`secretKeyRef` populated by external-secrets from Vault. lance-ray uses **workload identity** (no durable
secret).

### 5. Drop the demo scaffolding (rask supersedes it)
- `chart/templates/{age-postgres,rustfs,backup-pg,backup-snapshot}.yaml` → CNPG / rustfs-operator.
- `frontend/` + the zone Deployments + `gateway.yaml` → rask's SvelteKit frontends + Traefik Ingress.
  **Grafted-shape (P5, 2026-07-22):** `frontend/` is now a Turborepo + bun workspace in rask's exact shape —
  the 4 `components/frontends/<zone>` apps (home/lakehouse/media/annotator) on the shared `@repo/ui` design
  system + the `@repo/api` seam (the old single `apps/web` app + `@repo/ui` were retired in P5) — so folding
  in is a directory graft of the zones into `rask/components/frontends/`, not untangling a monolith.
- `openbao` dev-mode + the dev `infra-credentials` static Secret → external-secrets from rask's Vault.
- The `dex` demo IdP → rask's real IdP (or keep for local-only).

### 6. The media plane — absent from every earlier version of this document

`services/{viewer,search,annotator}` merged in under #91 (`docs/LANCE_NS_HANDOFF.md`) and this checklist has
never mentioned them. They are part of the unit that merges, and one of them carries the merge's sharpest
edge:

- **The corpus is a node `hostPath`** (`/var/media-corpus` on this kind node), not a governed table. That is
  fine on a single-node dev cluster and **will not survive a move to rask's cluster** — a hostPath binds a
  pod to a node that happens to hold the data. This is #103 ("media plane on the governed warehouse: corpus
  as registered project tables"), which is deferred today and becomes **blocking at the merge**. Decide
  between: register the corpus as project tables on the governed warehouse (the intended shape), or give
  rask a PVC/object-store path for it.
- **The viewer needs its memory tier.** It was OOM-killed serving thumbnails and now runs 1536Mi/768Mi,
  sized from a measured 955Mi cgroup peak. Carry the tier, not the default.
- **The encoders are URLs, not Deployments** (`encoders.*Url`). This cluster has no `nvidia.com/gpu` in node
  capacity, so vector/hybrid/rerank render disabled with the reason. If rask has GPUs, the same values point
  at real servers with no code change — the wiring is already proven to flip 503 → 200.

### 7. Live streams need the ingress to permit them — on Traefik, not nginx

Every zone's shell now holds a `query.live` SSE stream open for the run-notification bell. Proven here at
**269.6s with 0 streams severed**, past both nginx's 60s default and Bun's 255s `IDLE_TIMEOUT`. That rests on
two things, and only the second travels:

- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: 3600` on our Ingress — **rask uses Traefik**, so this needs
  its equivalent (a `ServersTransport` / `responseForwarding` setting) or every zone reconnects on a timer and
  each reconnect re-primes the event window and writes an audit record.
- The application-level keepalive in `@repo/api/runs-feed`, which re-yields the last pulse every 20s. That is
  ours and moves with the code.

`scripts/verify_live_stream_timeout.mjs` takes `HOLD_S`; run it past 255 against rask's ingress to confirm.

## lance-ray seam contract (so the real job drops in)
The dummy producer/movers define the contract the real Ray Data jobs must reproduce **exactly**:

- **Producer (head):** write the raw Lance dataset, then **publish ONE OpenLineage run event** to the Dapr
  pubsub `lineage-pubsub` / topic `lineage.events.v1` — `inputs=[]` → `outputs=[raw_events]`, the `WROTE` edge
  carrying the **Lance version** facet (`DatasetVersionDatasetFacet`). **That is all the real Ray job does.**
  ⚠️ **It must NOT publish `medallion.raw` itself** — post-B2 the deployed lance-ray app *subscribes* to the
  lineage topic (`/raw-arrival`) and publishes the first `medallion.raw` trigger when it sees a raw-namespace
  write. A job that also published `medallion.raw` would **double-fire the cascade**. The head is event-driven:
  emit the raw-write event; the arrival subscription does the triggering.
- **Each mover:** subscribe to its upstream trigger → transform (read the from-stage Lance version-range as a
  CDF, write the to-stage) → emit the **`DERIVED_FROM`** OpenLineage edge → publish the next trigger.
- **Gold mover (terminal):** write the gold dataset **with the embedded `lineage` JSONB column** (per
  `scripts/medallion_demo.py: write_gold`) → no next trigger. This is the durable, exportable artifact.
- **Authz:** when `MEDALLION_FGA_ENABLED`, the mover checks `can_create_table` (writer) / `can_promote`
  (validator, silver→gold) as its **service identity** before emitting; unauthorized → `DROP`.
- **Creds:** the job authenticates with **workload identity** (KubeRay projected SA / OIDC token) and vends
  short-TTL, table-scoped creds via the catalog `POST /v1/table/{id}/credentials` (web_identity flow). **No
  durable secret on compute.**

Reproduce those four behaviors in the Ray Data job and the cascade keeps working unchanged.

## Verification (the merge is correct when…)
- `scripts/governance_e2e.sh` + the medallion e2e run **against rask's CNPG + rustfs-operator stores** (not the
  in-cluster hand-rolled ones) and stay green.
- `tests/integration/test_spec_conformance.py` still passes (catalog surface intact).
- A real lance-ray run produces a **gold dataset with the JSONB lineage** + `/reconcile` returns `in_sync`
  against the on-disk Lance version.
- `helm template` of rask's chart shows the catalog/lineage/medallion/compaction workloads pointing at
  `<release>-postgres` / `<release>-rustfs`, with **no in-cluster DNS leaks** and **no plaintext secrets**.

## Open decisions (resolve before/early in the merge)
1. **AGE on CNPG** — custom AGE image vs separate operand vs Lance-native graph (`docs/DECISIONS.md` #age-on-cnpg-vs-lance-native-graph-the-lineage-store-decision). Affects §1.
2. ~~**Tenancy**~~ — **overtaken by shipped work, no longer a decision.** This read "the repo is
   single-warehouse; confirm one warehouse-per-deploy stays the model". It is not: `chart/values.yaml`'s
   `#3-A per-warehouse physical multi-tenancy` provisions a physically separate bucket per warehouse and
   binds top-level namespaces to it (Lakekeeper parity, #27), and #84 added per-tenant medallion zones with a
   project-level policy default. rask's single implicit `default` project is the side that has to widen —
   its services would sit under one project in our model, which is the degenerate case and works unchanged.
3. **Catalog 501s** — **confirmed 7** against `docs/COVERAGE.md` (47/54 backed). A crude `grep -c 501` over
   `services/catalog` reads 8 and is wrong — it counts prose. The 7 genuinely backend-stubbed ops (`docs/COVERAGE.md`: rename / backfill /
   alter_transaction / MV create+refresh / batch-create+batch-commit versions) stay 501 until the upstream
   Rust `DirectoryNamespace` (or a REST/managed backend) implements them — a parallel upstream contribution,
   independent of the merge. (Was "13"; version describe/create/delete + branches are now backed — see the
   COVERAGE correction.)
4. **Observability** — share rask's one GreptimeDB or keep separate per workload.
