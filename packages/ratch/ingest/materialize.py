"""Materialize external blob-v2 columns into Lance-managed bytes — the lance-ns way.

lance-ns's medallion ingest (``services/medallion/services/ingest.py::ingest_to_bronze``)
writes media as a **managed** blob-v2 column — the bytes live *in* the dataset — so a
plain directory copy to S3 carries them and they resolve anywhere, with no client S3
creds and no dangling external pointer. Our ingest writes ``documents.media_blob`` as an
**external** ``Blob.from_uri`` (``file://``) reference, which only resolves where that path
exists (fine on the build box, broken in a pod / on S3-only compute).

This converts external → managed **in place**, mirroring lance-ns's own re-wrap
(``compute._carry_forward``: ``read_blobs`` resolves each pointer to bytes, then
``blob_array`` re-writes them managed at file format 2.2). Run it locally (where the
``file://`` sources still resolve) *before* moving the dataset to S3; afterwards the
dataset is fully self-contained — the RASK_LANDING §4.4 remediation, as code.

    External ``Blob.from_uri`` pointers become managed bytes; already-managed columns
    (e.g. inline thumbnails) are re-wrapped to the same bytes. The table is overwritten
    via the sanctioned :func:`~ratch.core.dataset.overwrite_dataset` path so the 2.2 +
    stable-row-id invariants and any descriptor stamp survive. Note the overwrite
    re-creates the table, so it DROPS any indexes (rebuild them after) and null blobs
    stay null; run it on the media table, not an indexed frame table, or reindex.
