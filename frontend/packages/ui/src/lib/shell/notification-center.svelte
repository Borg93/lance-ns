	//
	// It renders run lifecycle from the lineage service's `GET /runs`: a run that STARTED, one that
	// COMPLETED, one that FAILED with its error_message, and progress where `progress_total` is set.
	// It does NOT fetch — the zone owns the transport (that is what keeps @repo/ui free of any BFF
	// coupling and keeps this testable), and hands the rows in as a prop.
	//
	// Read/dismiss state is bindable rather than owned: unbound it works standalone (per-tab memory),
	// bound it is the zone's to persist per subject. Both sets are keyed by NOTIFICATION id
