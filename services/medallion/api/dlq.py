"""The medallion dead-letter parking route (Dapr-native DLQ — docs/RESILIENCE.md gap #2).

When a subscription declares a ``deadLetterTopic`` and the sidecar's Resiliency retry policy is
exhausted, Dapr publishes the failed delivery here and ACKs the original — instead of the message
silently ceasing to exist after ``maxDeliver``. This route is the parking lot's floor: it logs the
parked message LOUDLY (ERROR — operators alert on it) and acks. Deliberately no auto-requeue: the
message already failed a full retry schedule, so re-firing it blind would loop the cascade; the
operator replays from the retained JetStream stream (or re-triggers the stage) after fixing the
cause. Registered only when the app's DLQ topic is configured, so default deployments are unchanged.
