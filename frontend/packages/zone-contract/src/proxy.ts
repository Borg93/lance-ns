/**
 * The local composition edge: one origin, all zones — the dev-time stand-in for the cluster Ingress.
 *
 * Without it, `turbo run dev` gives you four separate origins on four ports, and every cross-zone
 * behaviour the estate depends on is unreproducible locally: the sealed session cookie is per-origin so
 * a login does not carry, `data-sveltekit-reload` hard navigations go to the wrong host, and the shared
 * `mode-watcher` theme key is scoped to whichever port you happened to be on. Those are exactly the
 * bugs that only show up in the composed page, which is the class the micro-frontends skill says you
 * must have a local harness for.
 *
 * It routes by longest path prefix to the zone that owns it, straight out of
 * `components/frontends/home/microfrontends.json` — the same file the Ingress rules, the base paths and
 * the zone-contract tests are all checked against, so there is no second source of truth. A zone that
 * is not running answers 502 with which zone and which port, instead of a connection reset.
 *
 *   bun run dev:proxy            # or `bun run dev` at the frontend root, which starts both
 *   PROXY_PORT=5200 bun src/proxy.ts
