"""Dual-auth for ``POST /produce`` (#64): the DAPR app-api-token OR a signed-in project admin.

The cascade head must never be forgeable (a raw-write event fabricates provenance), so the existing
service-to-service guard — the shared app-api-token — is kept UNCHANGED. This adds a SECOND, human door:
a signed-in OIDC user who holds ``can_administer`` on the project may trigger produce, so the web BFF can
forward the *user's* bearer and the web pod never holds the service token (no secrets-posture change).

Fail-closed at every step: no service token configured is dev-open (matching the old ``require_dapr_token``);
a matching Dapr token passes (service path) — but only for the CONFIGURED project, since the shared token
carries no tenant identity (crossing tenants takes a user bearer); otherwise an OIDC bearer is REQUIRED
and must be valid (else 401) AND resolve to a project admin (else 403), with an OpenFGA outage failing to
503 — never a silent allow; a request carrying neither credential is 403. OIDC enabled with NO verifier
wired (startup/discovery skew) is 503 for a bearer-presenting caller — an auth-layer outage, not a caller
verdict (the catalog/lineage ``security.py`` invariant). Every door decision — the ``can_administer``
allow/deny/outage AND the service-token acceptance — is audited on the ``lance.audit`` stream (#41).
