"""Dapr pub/sub subscription for the catalog's own control-plane change-event stream.

The catalog **publishes** ``CatalogControlEvent``s (``core/control_emit.py``) onto the dedicated broadcast
component ``catalog-control-pubsub`` (topic ``catalog.control.v1``) and also **subscribes** to it here —
**without** a ``queueGroupName``, so **every** catalog replica receives **every** event (broadcast fan-out,
not a competing-consumer group) and appends it to its own per-replica ring buffer
(``core/control_buffer.py``). The poll endpoint (``GET /v1/events``) then serves each replica's buffer to
the console. There is **no broker client in app code** — the Dapr sidecar owns delivery; this is a plain
HTTP route the sidecar POSTs each event to.

``DaprApp(app)`` always serves GET ``/dapr/subscribe`` (the registration the sidecar reads at startup); the
subscription itself is registered **only** when control eventing is enabled (``control_emit_enabled``,
matching the emitter gate in ``main.py``), so an HTTP-only / control-off deployment carries no always-live
ingest route. The thin ``main`` builds ``app`` first, then calls :func:`register_control_dapr` so the
subscription is wired after ``app`` exists (the same import-order constraint as lineage's split).
