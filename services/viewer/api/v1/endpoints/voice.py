"""Voice endpoints — table status + "find this voice elsewhere" similarity.

Thin HTTP layer over :mod:`viewer.services.voice_service`: it resolves the
request's dataset (optional ``dataset`` query param, ``None`` → the default
DB), whitelists ``doc_id`` against the descriptor's identity pattern before
any service code inlines it into a Lance filter literal, and owns the
lock-guarded lazy voice encoder on ``state.voice_encoder``. The GET handlers
stay sync — every read is a blocking Lance call, which the threadpool absorbs;
the upload POST is async to await the multipart body, then offloads the
blocking decode + CPU embed + Lance reads to the threadpool.

No ``from __future__ import annotations`` here: FastAPI introspects these
signatures at runtime, so the annotations stay real objects.
