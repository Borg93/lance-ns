"""Catalog wire schemas — the request/response + value Pydantic models the API exposes.

Gathered here (mirroring ``services/lineage/schemas.py``) instead of scattered inline across the endpoint
modules, so the wire contract has one home and the endpoints stay routing-only. Grouped by concern. Class
names are the OpenAPI schema names, so they are preserved verbatim on any move.

Domain value objects that are NOT wire schemas stay where they belong: ``VendedCredentials`` in
``core/vending`` (a credential-vending value type it owns) and ``InputPin`` in ``core/lineage_emit`` (a
lineage-emit input reference).
