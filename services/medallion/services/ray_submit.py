"""Submit a stage-transform Ray job to the ray-lance cluster via the Ray Jobs REST API.

The event-driven real-Ray path (``MEDALLION_RAY_ENABLED``): a mover submits ``scripts/ray_stage_job.py``
(baked into the ray-lance image) to the Ray cluster IN RESPONSE TO its Dapr cascade trigger, instead of the
in-process fake-Ray ``compute.transform_stage``. Uses only ``httpx`` against the Ray Jobs REST API — no
``ray`` package in the mover image.

Idempotent under at-least-once redelivery: the submission id is DETERMINISTIC per (stage, token), so a
redelivered trigger (the handler blocks until the job finishes, which can exceed the 30s ack window)
RE-ATTACHES to the same job and polls it, rather than starting a second concurrent job that would race the
write. A failure (submit error, FAILED job, or timeout) raises so the mover returns RETRY and the sidecar
redelivers; on redelivery a terminally FAILED/STOPPED job with the same id is DELETED and resubmitted fresh
(so the retry runs on a healthy worker rather than re-observing the same failure), while a still-running job
is re-attached and polled. Production KubeRay handles in-job task retry/orchestration.

Known limitation (STAGE path only): ``submit_stage_job`` blocks until the job finishes, so a job that runs
longer than maxDeliver × ackWait (~2.5 min at the defaults) exhausts redelivery — it suits bounded-duration
stage transforms. The TRAIN path (``submit_train_job``, #115a) is exactly the async-completion redesign this
paragraph used to call future work: submit-and-ack, the job emits its own lifecycle, and — unlike the stage
path — a terminally FAILED prior job is NEVER deleted-and-resubmitted. The two functions deliberately share
``_submission_id`` but keep separate submit protocols (accepted #115a deviation from "extract one core":
their re-attach semantics differ at the terminal-failure branch; if you fix the shared POST/GET protocol in
one, mirror it in the other). See docs/RESILIENCE.md + docs/RAY-TRAIN.md.
