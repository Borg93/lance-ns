<!-- The estate-shared mode-watcher owns the `.dark` class, mounted exactly as every other zone
     mounts it. That is the whole point: the theme choice lives in ONE origin-wide localStorage
     key, so the navbar's toggle works here and a light estate stays light when you hop into the
     annotator. Previously this zone pinned `class="dark"` on <html> and read its own
     `lance-media-theme` key, which is why it rendered dark against a light estate. First paint
     is handled by the boot script in app.html (this zone's canvas route is ssr=false, so the
     mode-watcher head script other zones rely on never reaches the document). -->

<!-- The SHARED estate shell in canvas mode: no sidebar, no breadcrumb, `children` gets the full height —
     but the header is the same component every other zone renders, so the project switcher and the identity
     cluster sit in the same place at the same size. This zone used to hand-roll its own <header> around a
     bare TopNavbar, which is how its account avatar came to sit on the LEFT (the hand-rolled version omitted
     the `min-w-0 flex-1` AppShell passes) and why it had no project switcher and no breadcrumb while the
     other three did. Two implementations of one header, free to drift. -->
