"""The catalog control-plane change-event — a typed governance/metadata mutation notice.

Distinct from the OpenLineage **data** events (`catalog/core/lineage_emit.py`, which describe table
*writes*): this is the **control-plane** stream — a grant changed, a warehouse was deactivated, a policy
was set, a namespace/table was created/dropped/renamed. Those mutations already land in the durable audit
trail (#41, GreptimeDB); this is the real-time **subscribable** layer on top, so internal consumers (cache
invalidation, an in-estate reaction worker) and the admin console get a live feed (Polaris/Lakekeeper ship
the same).

Shared here (`services/common`) so producers (the catalog) and consumers import ONE model. The event is a
plain pointer payload (claim-check invariant — no data), published onto the existing Dapr/NATS bus by
`catalog/core/control_emit.py`; Dapr wraps it in a CloudEvent envelope at the sidecar (the same envelope the
lineage subscriber already speaks). An event is a **refresh hint**, never authoritative data: a consumer
re-reads state through the normal FGA-governed path, so a dropped/duplicated/late event only costs a
redundant re-read. `event_id` is the client-side dedupe key.
