    """Ingest (dummy) the raw dataset and emit its write event — the event-driven cascade head.

    Seeds ``raw_events`` (with compute) and emits ONE OpenLineage event for it; lance-ray's ``/raw-arrival``
    subscription reacts to that event and publishes the ``medallion.raw`` trigger, so the cascade is driven
    by the arrival event, not this call. The raw-write emit is therefore the **cascade head** — if it is
    dropped, the entire raw→bronze→silver→gold run silently never happens. So a publish failure surfaces as
    **503** (not the 202 that would hide it), letting the caller retry; the request is otherwise 202.

    Guarded by ``require_dapr_token`` (the shared app-api-token) so an in-cluster workload can't forge the
    cascade head: /produce is a direct operator trigger (not sidecar-delivered), and without this any pod that
    could reach ``lance-ray:8000`` could drive the pipeline / fabricate medallion provenance. No-op in dev
    (unset token); enforced once APP_API_TOKEN is set. A NetworkPolicy (chart) is the network-isolation layer.

    ``Idempotency-Key`` (optional) is the retry pairing this route's own 503+Retry-After contract demands:
    a retry that REUSES the key converges onto the same cascade token (deterministic run_ids → the graph
    MERGEs the duplicate head) instead of double-firing two unrelated raw→gold runs.

    ``project`` (optional, #84 per-tenant routing) seeds THAT project's warehouse
    (``<root>/medallion/raw``, resolved off the warehouse registry) and stamps the project into the head
    event so the whole cascade routes per-tenant; ``authorize_produce`` gates ``can_administer`` on the
    requested project. Unresolvable (routing disabled, or no active warehouse) → **409** (fail closed —
    never a silent fallback to the shared root). Absent → today's single-tenant behavior, unchanged.
