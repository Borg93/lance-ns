"""Request body-size limit — a pure-ASGI middleware that rejects oversized bodies with 413.

The Arrow-IPC write endpoints (``/v1/table/{id}/create|insert|merge_insert``) read the whole request body
into memory before the handler runs, so a single unbounded POST — e.g. a multi-GB media blob pushed through
the catalog instead of the direct storage/vending path — OOMs the worker. This enforces the cap *before* the
body is buffered, two ways: a fast ``Content-Length`` reject, and a streaming byte counter that catches a
chunked or length-omitting client. Oversized requests get a problem+json 413 steering them to the direct path.

Pure ASGI (not ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``) so the cap applies as bytes arrive, independent of how the endpoint
reads the body — and so it composes below the app's exception handlers without buffering the request itself.
