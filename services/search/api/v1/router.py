"""Search endpoints — GET (query string) and POST (multipart, image upload).

Ported from ``backend.search.router`` (minus the doc-transcript /
chunk-alignments sub-resources, which belong to the media group). Both handlers
build a :class:`SearchSpec`, short-circuit empty input, and delegate to the
framework-free :func:`run_search`. The wire shape is unchanged — same paths,
params, and hit shape — plus one addition: an OPTIONAL ``dataset`` query param
selecting the Lance DB (``None`` → the default dataset). Metadata filter params
are no longer hardcoded fields: whatever names the dataset's descriptor lists
under ``search.filterable`` are read dynamically from the query string / form,
so ``?language=sv`` keeps working against the default corpus without this
module knowing the name.

GET stays sync (threadpooled); POST is async to await the upload, then offloads
the blocking vLLM + Lance work. No ``from __future__ import annotations`` here:
FastAPI introspects these signatures at runtime, so the annotations stay real
objects.
