"""Access-review endpoints (#51): who holds which ``can_*`` action on a table or namespace.

``POST …/access/list`` answers the standing-access question the #41 audit trail cannot ("who *can*
read this?", not "who *did*"): for every ``can_*`` action the compiled model defines on the type, it
asks OpenFGA ListUsers — which expands role assignees, team members, and the parent cascade, so the
answer is effective access, not just direct tuples. The relation set comes from the model the app
actually loads (never a hand-kept list), so a model edit is reflected here automatically and
``test_fga_model_contract`` proves every queried pair exists.

Owner-tier gated by the router-level ``authorize`` (``access/list`` maps to ``can_drop`` /
``can_delete`` — an enumeration reveals principals, so it clears the same bar as destroying the
object); the gate audits the authz decision, and the endpoint additionally emits a dedicated
``access_review`` audit event (the disclosure itself, distinguishable from an actual drop — the same
two-layer pattern as credential vending). Fail-closed: an OpenFGA outage is a 503, never an empty
grant list that reads as "nobody has access".

Two properties of "effective access" are accepted by design and worth knowing when reading a review:
the expansion follows the parent cascade, so a leaf-table owner sees individual grantees who hold
access only via namespace/warehouse/project team or role grants (within-tenant upward visibility —
the cascade never crosses projects); and OpenFGA's ListUsers has no pagination, so a relation held
by more subjects than the server's ``listUsersMaxResults`` cap returns a partial list (the wrapper
logs a warning when a result looks capped).
