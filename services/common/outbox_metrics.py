"""OpenTelemetry domain metrics for the #4 transactional lineage outbox (OTLP-direct to GreptimeDB).

WHY (GOAL-prove-it P1.1): the outbox is an external boundary (S3 + pub/sub) that carried ZERO of the four
golden signals — a direct violation of `python-infrastructure/references/observability.md`, which requires
them "for every external boundary (HTTP, DB, queue, cache)". Concretely: every durability property #4
claims was **unobservable**. An outbox that silently stops draining — the one failure that loses lineage
forever — looked exactly like an outbox that is working. The audit ranked this the highest-ROI fix.

The signals, mapped to the four:
  · Traffic  — staged / published / dropped counters (the happy path's rate)
  · Errors   — publish_failed (event left staged = the crash window doing its job) + poison_dropped
  · Saturation — DEPTH and OLDEST-AGE gauges: the alertable pair. Depth > 0 sustained means the relay is
    not draining; oldest-age bounds how much lineage is at risk. These are what a human is actually paged on.
  · Latency  — the publish itself is already covered by the Dapr sidecar's own spans.

Bounded cardinality (observability.md): NO run_id / dataset / token labels — those are unbounded and belong
on spans and logs, not metric attributes. These series carry no attributes at all.
