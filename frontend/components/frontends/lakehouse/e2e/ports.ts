/**
 * Every port this zone's e2e run binds — declared ONCE.
 *
 * There were four copies of these numbers (playwright.config.ts, the mock catalog's own Bun.serve,
 * the control-events spec's fetch helper, session.ts's default origin). Moving the mock catalog off
 * a port the media zone also claimed changed one of them, and the other three kept pointing at the
 * old number: the mock came up where nobody was looking and the suite failed with ECONNREFUSED.
 *
 * `@repo/zone-contract` asserts no two zones bind the same port and scans this file, so a collision
 * fails a test rather than being discovered as a mystery timeout.
