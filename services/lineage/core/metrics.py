"""OpenTelemetry domain metrics for the lineage ingest path.

Auto-instrumentation gives generic HTTP server/client metrics; these are the *business* golden
signals you'd actually alert on — how many lineage events we ingest vs. drop vs. retry, and how long
ingest takes. They go out via the OTel SDK (activated by ``opentelemetry-instrument``) **OTLP-direct to
GreptimeDB** (no Collector — mirrors rask), queryable in PromQL / Perses.

Cardinality is bounded on purpose (the otel skill's #1 cost driver): the only attribute is the bounded,
namespaced ``lance.lineage.outcome`` — per-run / per-table identifiers belong on spans and logs, never on
metric attributes. (Custom attributes use the project's dot-namespaced `lance.*` convention —
deliberately NOT the otel skill's reverse-DNS letter, pinned in todo_fable; in PromQL the dots become
underscores → ``lance_lineage_outcome``.)
``metrics.get_meter`` returns a proxy that binds lazily, so creating the instruments at import time
(before ``opentelemetry-instrument`` installs the real MeterProvider) is safe.
