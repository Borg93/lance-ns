    ``tag`` is resolved to its version HERE via the dataplane's tag store: the native backend at
    pylance 8.0.0 silently IGNORES a describe-request ``tag`` (probed 2026-07-10 — a nonexistent tag
    described the LATEST version with no error), so forwarding it would lie; the catalog resolves
    (404 on an unknown tag, like ``/tags/version``) and describes at the resolved version instead.

    ``vend_credentials`` (spec 0.9) returns short-lived, table-scoped ``storage_options`` in the response —
    the SPEC'S OWN way for a client to get credentials. We previously ignored the field entirely and offered
    only a bespoke ``POST /{id}/credentials``, which meant a GENERIC Lance client (including lance-ray in
    REST mode) got no credentials and had no way to discover our endpoint: interop-breaking, and the one
    confirmed reinvention in the 2026-07-14 audit. ``/credentials`` remains as the richer superset (tiers,
    web-identity exchange).

    READ TIER ONLY, deliberately. The router already gates describe on the reader rung; vending a WRITE
    credential from a read-authorized call would be a privilege escalation. A write credential still requires
    ``POST /{id}/credentials?tier=write``, which separately checks ``can_write_data``.

    Multi-base tables fall back to server-mediated (no storage_options): the STS session policy is scoped to
    the table's PRIMARY root bucket, so a vended client could not reach fragments living in a registered data
    base — the same #3-B ⊥ #2 conflict the credentials endpoint already handles.
