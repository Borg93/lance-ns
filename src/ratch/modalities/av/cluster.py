"""Global speaker clustering + eval helpers for ``ratch cluster-speakers``.

Fits :class:`evoc.EVoC` over the per-speaker voiceprints in ``speakers.lance`` and
rewrites the table's ``speaker_cluster`` column. The written assignment is NOT
EVoC's persistence-max ``labels_`` (which at this scale tracks the recording
channel, an order of magnitude coarser than people) but the coarsest
``cluster_layers_`` entry whose within-video false-merge rate stays under
:data:`MAX_SAME_DOC_MERGE_RATE` — see :func:`select_identity_layer`.

The validation helpers (:func:`validate_known_identities`) report PASS/FAIL for a
human-labeled same-person pair (and one suspected pair) so the gate that runs
``cluster-speakers --validate`` can decide whether a FAIL means rejecting the
clustering, loosening ``--min-cluster-size``, or shipping the feature as
experimental.
