"""Operations implemented in-process via pylance.

The native ``DirectoryNamespace`` stubs several table data, schema, and tag
operations. These functions fill the gap: resolve the table's dataset via the
namespace, then perform the operation with pylance.

Most functions take ``(ns, storage_options, request)`` and return the typed ``lance_namespace`` response
model. Exceptions: ``update_field_metadata`` takes ``(ns, storage_options, table_id, updates)``; and
``create_table`` is the one facade that receives the raw Arrow-IPC ``data`` and writes it directly at file
format 2.2 with stable row ids — the durable row identity row-id lineage needs.
