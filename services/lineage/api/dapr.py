"""Dapr pub/sub subscription wiring for durable catalog→lineage ingest (#25).

The catalog publishes OpenLineage events to the Dapr ``pubsub.jetstream`` component; the sidecar
delivers each one to this service over HTTP. ``DaprApp(app)`` also serves GET ``/dapr/subscribe`` (the
registration the sidecar reads at startup); it is wired unconditionally — harmless without a sidecar —
while the actual subscription is registered only when Dapr ingest is enabled, so an HTTP-only deployment
carries no always-live ingest route.

The thin ``main`` builds ``app`` first, then calls :func:`register_dapr` so the subscription is wired
after ``app`` exists (the import-order constraint the split must preserve).
