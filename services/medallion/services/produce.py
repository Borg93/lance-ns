"""The lance-ray producer's ingest business logic — the dummy raw writer at the head of the pipeline.

:func:`produce` (with ``compute_enabled``) seeds a real ``raw_events`` Lance dataset, then emits ONE
OpenLineage event announcing that write. It does NOT itself trigger the cascade — lance-ray's own
``/raw-arrival`` subscription (:mod:`medallion.services.ingest_trigger`) reacts to that raw-write event and
publishes the ``medallion.raw`` trigger, so the pipeline is driven by the raw-data-arrival EVENT, not this
call (GOAL 4 B2). In production this is a real Ray Data job; here it is a dummy emitter, which is all the
event-driven demo needs.

Best-effort: a sidecar/broker outage logs + still returns (never 500s the producer) — the catalog contract.

    With ``compute_enabled`` it FIRST seeds a real ``raw_events`` Lance dataset (the fake lance-ray ingest)

    OpenLineage event for ``raw_events``. It does NOT publish ``medallion.raw`` — lance-ray's ``/raw-arrival``
    subscription reacts to this raw-write event and fires the trigger, so the cascade is event-driven.

    ``token`` is the caller's idempotency key (skill rule: an operation whose route invites retry must
    pair it with one): the route's 503 tells the caller to retry, but the publish timeout is ambiguous —
    the sidecar may have accepted the event before the timeout fired — so a retry that minted a FRESH
    token would double-fire the cascade head as two unrelated runs. A reused token converges instead:
    every downstream run_id derives from it, so the graph MERGEs the duplicate and the overwrite-writes
