"""Credential vending — hand an authorized client scoped ``storage_options`` for DIRECT object I/O.

Track B: instead of every byte flowing through the catalog (Mode B, the server-mediated Arrow-IPC path),
an authorized caller can request short-TTL, per-table, tier-scoped credentials and read/write the Lance
data on object storage itself (LanceDB SDK / lance-ray / pylance). The vendor plug is chosen at boot
(``LANCE_VENDING_MODE``): ``sts`` (AssumeRole + a per-table session policy — the recommended path),
``static`` (per-bucket keys), or ``mode_b`` (vends nothing → the client uses the data endpoints).

Authz: the router-level :func:`catalog.api.fga_deps.authorize` already required ``can_read_data`` on the
table (``credentials`` is mapped to the reader-data rung); a ``tier=write`` request additionally requires
``can_write_data`` here. So a reader gets read-scoped creds and a writer gets write-scoped creds — the
session policy then enforces the same scope at the object store.
