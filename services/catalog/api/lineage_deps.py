"""The shared read-back-and-emit trailer for catalog mutations that record versioned lineage.

Every endpoint whose native op commits a table change ends the same way: read the produced version +
per-version schema off the dataset, then publish a best-effort ``WROTE`` event. One helper (instead of a
copy per endpoint module) so the two correctness properties live in exactly one place:

* **single pinned open** — version and schema come from ONE ``open_dataset`` call, pinned to the version
  the write's response reported when it carries one, so a concurrent writer can never get version N+1's
  schema attached to version N's WROTE edge;
* **best-effort throughout** — the mutation is already committed when this runs, so a read-back failure
  degrades the lineage enrichment (versionless / schemaless emit) but never fails the request.

Ops that emit a versionless marker with no read-back (drop/deregister/declare/register) call
``emit_write_event`` directly.
