"""The shared warehouse-registry READ half (#84) — project → active warehouse root, on a local-fs
control root (the same pattern as the maintenance-policy registry tests: real records, no S3).

This resolver is what routes a per-tenant medallion trigger into its project's bucket, so the pinned
contracts are the fail-closed ones: unknown project → ``None`` (never a default root), deactivated
warehouses invisible, unsafe project ids rejected at the boundary, and the TTL cache never hides a
freshly provisioned warehouse (misses are not cached).
