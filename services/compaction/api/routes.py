"""The Dapr cron HTTP surface: the binding-name POST route (runs one sweep) + its OPTIONS ack.

A ``bindings.cron`` component POSTs to ``/<binding-name>`` every interval; OPTIONS is Dapr's
binding-discovery pre-flight. The POST is guarded by ``require_dapr_token`` so only the sidecar's cron
tick may trigger a sweep. Blocking Lance/S3 IO runs in the threadpool so the event loop stays free.

# the other is reading). Module-level asyncio.Lock created without binding a loop (py3.10+); with
# compactionReplicas=1 (values.yaml) this is cluster-wide single-flight. The reconcile sweep does the same
# with a pg advisory lock — compaction is stateless (no DB), so an in-process lock is the analog. A tick

# so re-running is redundant, and queuing would pile ticks up behind a long sweep. (prod-readiness P5)
