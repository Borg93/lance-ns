"""Read-side warehouse-registry resolver (#84) — project → active warehouse root, off the control bucket.

The catalog WRITES warehouse records (``services/catalog/services/warehouses.py``) as plain JSON at
``<control_root>/_warehouses/<id>.json`` with fields ``{id, bucket, root_uri, project, status, ...}``.
This module is the shared READ half for services that must route by *project* without a catalog client
(the established catalog↔compaction contract shape — see :mod:`common.maintenance_policies`): the
medallion movers/producer resolve a project-carrying trigger to that project's warehouse root and lay the
stages out as ``<root_uri>/medallion/<namespace>``.

Records are immutable except ``status``, so resolution accepts short staleness through a per-process TTL
cache — positive hits only, meaning a freshly provisioned warehouse is visible immediately while a
deactivation is honored within one TTL window (default 5s; ``WAREHOUSE_REGISTRY_TTL_SECONDS``
overrides). All IO is blocking; callers threadpool it.
