"""Automated data-quality assertions for the medallion quality gate.

A medallion stage that produced a real Lance dataset (compute on) can be VALIDATED before it promotes: the
mover runs cheap, exact assertions on the dataset it just wrote — does it have rows? is the key column free
of nulls? — and emits them as the standard OpenLineage ``dataQualityAssertions`` facet. When the quality
GATE is enabled, a failed assertion BLOCKS promotion: the failed run is still recorded (lineage keeps the
assertions, so the bad batch is auditable) but the next stage is never triggered, so bad data can't cascade.

This is the automated *validator* half of governance, and it composes with the FGA gate: FGA decides who
MAY promote (a registered identity holding the role); quality decides whether the DATA is good enough to.
Both gate movement. The checks use ``count_rows`` (with a filter) so they never materialise the table.
