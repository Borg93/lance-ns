/**
 * A bounded, promise-keyed memo for GETs whose response cannot change without the URL changing.
 *
 * Why this exists, measured 2026-07-26 through the ingress: `/api/atlas/points` returned **6,679,228
 * bytes** and was re-fetched on every mount and every Text/Visual toggle — 25.5 MiB in about thirty seconds
 * of ordinary clicking, which OOM-killed the viewer mid-measurement (`exitCode 137`, limit 512Mi) and took
 * the media plane to 502. The projection for a given space and dataset cannot change without a redeploy, so
 * every request after the first was waste.
 *
 * It memoises the **promise**, not the value, which is what makes the concurrent case work: two components
 * mounting in the same tick share one request instead of racing two multi-megabyte downloads. A rejection
 * evicts its own entry, because a failed load must stay retryable — caching a failure would turn one bad
 * moment into a permanently broken surface.
 *
 * The URL is the whole key on purpose. Callers build URLs that already carry a version token or a content
 * hash (`&v=6`, `api/thumbnail/<hash>`), so **invalidation is free**: bump the token and every old key
 * becomes unreachable at once. There is no TTL to tune and no invalidation message for anyone to maintain.
 * That property is what makes this safe in the browser; do not point it at an endpoint whose body can change
 * under a fixed URL.
 *
 * In the tab, deliberately, not in the zone's server. Every read here is authorised per user, and a cache of
 * authorised results in a shared server needs a key derived from the subject — get that key wrong and it is
 * a cross-user disclosure rather than a slow page. A tab-local memo is per-user by construction, needs no
 * coherence story across replicas (the estate runs `frontend.replicas: 2` with no session affinity), and has
 * no failure mode of its own.
