"""Cross-encoder head rerank: re-score the top ``rerank_n`` hits, keep the tail.

Ported from ``backend.search.rerank``; the scored text column now comes from the
descriptor's ``display.body`` instead of a hardcoded name. Pure: no Lance, no
exceptions. The reranker getter (passed in) is the only dependency, and that
getter owns its own 503 mapping (see :mod:`search.services.clients`).
