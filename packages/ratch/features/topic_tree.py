"""Build the topic hierarchy as a JSONB value in Lance (for the Tree treemap).

The per-chunk ``topic_l0…`` columns drive *filtering*; this module derives the
nested *hierarchy* (broadest layer → … → finest, with chunk counts) and stores it
as a single-row ``topics`` Lance table whose ``hierarchy`` column is Lance JSONB
(``pa.json_()`` — the same extension type used for ``alignments_json``). No sidecar
file: the tree lives in the dataset, the backend reads one row, the LayerChart
``<Treemap>`` renders it.

Pure Lance + stdlib (no Toponymy), so it runs in the normal ratch env — called by
``feature topics`` after the isolated worker writes the columns, and runnable
standalone to backfill an existing build:

    uv run python -c "from ratch.features.topic_tree import build_topic_tree; \\
        build_topic_tree('transcripts_v2.lance')"
