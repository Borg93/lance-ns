"""``GET /v1/events`` — the control-plane change-event poll endpoint (P2).

Serves this replica's in-memory ring buffer (``core/control_buffer.py``, fed by the broadcast Dapr
subscription in ``api/dapr.py``) to the admin console: events strictly after the caller's ``since`` cursor,
the new head cursor, and a ``reset`` flag when the cursor fell off the (bounded, drop-oldest) buffer. An
event is a **refresh hint**, never authoritative data — the console re-reads real state through the normal
FGA-governed path — so a lost/duplicated/late event only costs a redundant (or slightly delayed) re-read
(see ``control_buffer.py`` + ``docs/DECISIONS.md`` #control-events--fail-open-emit-contract).

**Estate-admin gated.** The feed is **estate-wide** — the buffer holds every replica's view of *every*
project's governance changes (broadcast subscription, no per-tenant partition). Observing it is therefore a
**platform** privilege, not a per-project one: the endpoint checks ``can_observe_events`` on the fixed root
object (``settings.fga_root_object`` = ``warehouse:lance_catalog``), an owner-tier action, so **authorization
scope == data scope** — a mere project admin gets a 403 (the #12 fix; the earlier per-project param let any
project admin read the whole estate). ``/v1/events`` matches no resource prefix in ``fga_deps.authorize`` so
the router-wide gate only sets the 401/503 floor; the ``can_observe_events`` decision is made here explicitly
(mirroring ``models.py``). A *meaningful* poll (events delivered or a reset) is audited
(``event_stream_opened``) — never an empty tick, so a 5s-polling console doesn't flood the audit trail.
