# AGE restore drill (prod-readiness P4) — RUN INSIDE the age-postgres pod (it has psql/pg_dump; the Dagger
# lineage-e2e AGE is not reachable from the runner). Proves the exact hazard docs/RUNBOOK-restore.md warns
# about: does a plain `pg_dump` of an Apache AGE database, restored into a fresh DB, KEEP the graph's labels
# and vertices — or does it come back with the ag_catalog metadata but no data (the known plain-pg_dump-of-AGE
# trap)? Self-contained on a throwaway `restore_drill` DB, so it never touches the real lineage graph.
# Exit 1 (labels lost) is a real, valuable finding: switch the backup to an AGE-aware dump, then re-drill.
