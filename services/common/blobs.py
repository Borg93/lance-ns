"""Blob-v2 column detection, shared across services.

Lance blob-v2 columns require file format ``>= 2.2`` and are identified by the
``lance.blob.v2`` Arrow extension type (registered when ``lance`` is imported).
These helpers let the catalog (create path) and the medallion compute (cascade)
recognise a blob column from an Arrow schema without materialising the payloads.

A blob-v2 column cannot be written at the default 2.1 format, so detecting one is
what routes a write onto the ``data_storage_version="2.2"`` path.
