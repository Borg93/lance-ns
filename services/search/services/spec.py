"""Normalized search request — pure validation, no Lance/HTTP/embedding deps.

Ported from ``backend.search.spec`` with the corpus-specific filter fields
removed: metadata filters are now read dynamically from the request against the
descriptor's ``search.filterable`` list (see :mod:`search.services.filters`),
so this model carries only the schema-agnostic knobs. ``mode`` is a ``StrEnum``
so FastAPI validates it at the route boundary (422 on an unknown mode); the
numeric fields clamp rather than reject, so the GET/POST handlers construct
``SearchSpec(...)`` directly without a factory.
