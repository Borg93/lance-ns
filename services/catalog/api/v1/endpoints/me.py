"""``GET /v1/me`` — the signed-in caller's self-describe: verified identity claims + effective standing.

The console shell needs one cheap call to render *who am I and what am I* — the verified subject, the
display claims, whether the caller is an estate admin, and which tenants they belong to (and at what
role). Everything here is DERIVED from the verified token + OpenFGA; nothing is caller-supplied, and the
response never discloses anything about *other* principals (unlike ``/v1/projects``, which is
estate-observer gated for exactly that reason — this route needs no FGA gate because its data scope is
the caller themself).

**Authenticated-only, no authorization gate.** Any VERIFIED token gets a 200; anonymous is 401 (there is
no self to describe). ``/v1/me`` matches no resource prefix in ``fga_deps.authorize``, so the router-wide
gate contributes only its 401/503 pre-path checks when FGA is on — the 401 floor is enforced here
explicitly so it also holds with FGA off.

**Display-only FGA lookups, degrading — never a 5xx.** ``estate_admin`` is ``can_observe_events`` on the
fixed root object (``settings.fga_root_object``) — the same estate-OBSERVER action that gates
``/v1/events`` + ``/v1/projects``, so the shell can decide whether those surfaces are even reachable.
``projects`` comes from the #51 ``fga.list_objects`` wrapper on the ``project`` type — ``can_administer``
first, then ``member`` (the model folds admins into members, so the admin-first pass wins the dedupe).
All lookups share one 2s wall-clock budget and each degrades on its own outage/expiry: an OpenFGA
brownout costs display fidelity, never the whole self-describe. None of them are audited — the #41 trail
records authorization *decisions* (allow/deny gates), and these gate nothing (the ``/v1/projects``
``_admins_for`` precedent). FGA off → ``estate_admin=true``, ``projects=[]`` (dev parity: every
``require_*`` gate is a no-op there, so the caller genuinely can do everything).
