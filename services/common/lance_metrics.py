"""Bridge Lance's NATIVE IO metrics into OpenTelemetry — pre-wired for the pylance 9 bump.

pylance ≥ 9.0 ships ``lance.otel.instrument_lance_metrics()`` (the ``pylance[otel]`` extra), which
registers Lance's Rust-side object-store/IO metrics as observable instruments on the global
``MeterProvider`` — the one ``opentelemetry-instrument`` already installs in every deployed service,
so the metrics flow through the existing OTLP → Vector → GreptimeDB pipeline with zero new config.

At the pinned pylance 8.0.0 the module does not exist (probed 2026-07-10, lance_docs refresh), so this
helper is a guarded no-op that logs which way it went: bumping the pylance pin is the ONLY step left to
light the metrics up in catalog / lineage / medallion / compaction (todo_fable §9 doc-audit pin). Call
it once per process, from the lifespan, after the auto-instrumentation wrapper has set the provider.
