"""A caller's bad SQL expression is a 4xx, not a 500.

``updates`` and ``predicate`` on the row-mutation endpoints are SQL fragments the CALLER writes, and Lance
validates them at execution time, raising ``Invalid user input: Schema error: No field named "Z". Valid
fields are id, v.`` — which escaped uncaught and became a 500 ``InternalError``. Found live
2026-07-26 driving ``POST /v1/table/{id}/update`` with an unquoted string literal (Lance reads that as a
column reference), against the deployed catalog on kind.

That is wrong three ways: it tells the caller the server broke when their expression was wrong, it buries
Lance's genuinely useful message (it lists the valid fields) under a generic body, and it spends the error
budget — a 500 is what alerting watches — on a client mistake.

Real dir namespace + real pylance, no mocks: the point is Lance's ACTUAL error, and a mock would only pin
the message we imagined it raises. That mattered here — writing these tests is what showed the exception
CLASS is inconsistent (``ValueError`` from ``update()``, ``OSError`` from ``delete()``, same message), so a
type-keyed guard would have fixed update and left delete returning 500s.
