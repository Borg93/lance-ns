"""Publish to the Dapr sidecar under a TIGHT per-site timeout — a hung sidecar must not pin the worker.

The Dapr async SDK already bounds every unary RPC (incl. ``PublishEvent``) with a client-side gRPC
deadline: ``DaprClientTimeoutInterceptorAsync`` applies ``DAPR_API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` on every call, and our
chart sets that to 30s on every app pod as the global backstop. But that knob is GLOBAL — a 5s value would
also throttle the same apps' ~80s retrying secret-store fetch — and ``publish_event`` exposes no per-call
timeout arg. So we wrap each publish in a deliberately tighter ``asyncio.timeout`` (default 5s) that fires
well before the 30s gRPC deadline, turning a wedged sidecar / NATS stall into a ``TimeoutError`` the existing
failure path already handles (mover → RETRY / redeliver; catalog+compaction emit → best-effort swallow)
without a coroutine sitting stalled for 30s. One helper so the tighter bound is applied at every publish site.

CLAIM-CHECK GUARD (§9 P1, 2026-07-11): events carry POINTERS (dataset/version/URI), never data — NATS
JetStream's default max message is ~1 MiB, so a data-shaped payload would fail at the broker ANYWAY,
just later and with an opaque transport error after the timeout. Because every publish site funnels
through this ONE helper, the invariant is enforced here: a payload past the hard cap raises
``ValueError`` naming the rule (fail fast, same failure semantics the caller already handles — the
publish did not happen either way), and a payload past the soft cap logs a WARNING (early visibility
for facet-bloat creep, docs/DATA-CONTRACT.md §4) without changing behavior.
