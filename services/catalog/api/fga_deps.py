"""OpenFGA authorization dependency.

Router-level guard: when FGA is enabled it maps the request (resource + operation) to a
``can_*`` ACTION relation defined in the model (``services/common/auth/model.fga``) and checks the
authenticated caller against OpenFGA. A no-op when FGA is disabled.

The op -> ``can_*`` mapping below is the ONLY policy logic in the app; the privilege math
(which rung each ``can_*`` reduces to, and how owner/writer/reader cascade through
``parent``) lives in the model — so it is testable in ``model.fga.yaml`` and precise for
``list_objects``. Mapping (behaviour-identical to the previous reader/writer/owner code):

  read ops   -> can_get_metadata / can_read_data        (reader rung)
  mutations  -> can_write_data / can_update_properties   (writer rung)
  lifecycle  -> can_drop / can_deregister / can_delete   (owner rung)
  create     -> can_create_table / can_create_namespace on the PARENT (create-on-parent)

Create-on-parent: creating a child authorizes the parent (the child has no id yet); a
top-level child gates on the catalog root only when ``fga_lock_root_create`` is set,
else it is open self-serve. Batch routes read the (Starlette-cached) body and check each
named table. Fail-closed twice over: an unwired client raises 503 here, and
``fga.check``/``fga.batch_check`` raise 503 on an OpenFGA outage rather than allowing.

    A transaction is a coordination artifact over its namespace's tables; nothing mints a per-transaction
    FGA object, so the previous ``table:<txn-id>`` check always denied (that object is never seeded).
    Instead:

    - A NAMESPACED txn id (``<ns>$<txn>``) inherits the caller's grant on ``namespace:<ns>``. ``describe``
      is a read (``can_get_metadata``); ``alter`` may commit/abort, so it is writer-tier
      (``can_update_properties``). Resolves on the FIRST call with no seed — this is the always-deny fix.
    - An OPAQUE root txn id (no enclosing namespace) is authorized against the ``transaction:`` object
      itself (``can_describe`` / ``can_set_status``), so it stays fail-closed until a grant is seeded on it.

    The dedicated ``transaction`` model type (``can_describe``/``can_set_property``/``can_set_status``/
    ``can_cancel``, cascading from ``parent``) backs the object-scoped branch and any future per-transaction
    direct grants; the finer set_status/set_property split lives in the model.

    The writer-tier relation on the PARENT branch must be one the ``namespace`` type actually defines: a
    namespace has no data plane, so ``can_write_data`` is a ``table``-only action and checking it against a
    ``namespace:`` object is a model error (OpenFGA 400 ``relation 'namespace#can_write_data' not found``)
    that fails closed to a 503 for EVERY caller — owners included. ``can_update_properties: writer`` IS the
    namespace writer rung, and it is exactly the rung the object-scoped branch resolves to for a parented
    transaction (``can_set_status: committer``, and ``committer`` ⊇ ``writer from parent``), so the two
