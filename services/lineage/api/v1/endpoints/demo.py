"""Demo-only data peek — reads the real Lance datasets on S3 so the UI can show *what is
changing in storage*: the schema at each Lance version, row counts, and gold's embedded JSONB
lineage.

This is **demo instrumentation, not core lineage**. It is mounted only when
``LINEAGE_DEMO_DATA_ENABLED`` is set, reads object storage directly with pylance (the same library
the catalog uses), and never touches the AGE graph. Endpoints are plain ``def`` so FastAPI runs the
blocking Lance I/O in its threadpool.

# --- Version-keyed peek cache (§2 perf, 2026-07-11). The peek's cost grew LINEARLY with total
# versions: one S3 dataset-open PER VERSION per dataset, polled every 2s. Lance versions are
# IMMUTABLE, so a version's schema entry can never change once read → per-version entries cache
# until they scroll out of the newest-K window. Incarnation identity (review 2026-07-11): a
# delete-and-recreate at the same URI restarts version numbers, and the new incarnation can reach
# ANY version count while nobody polls — so a bare version number is NOT a valid cache key. Every
# entry is therefore validated against the live manifest TIMESTAMP from ``ds.versions()`` (already
# fetched each tick — no extra opens): same (version, timestamp) = same immutable manifest; a
# mismatch = a dead incarnation's entry, rebuilt. Steady-state tick cost: ONE dataset-open (the
# probe) + the versions() listing, zero per-version opens. Benign races only (demo tier,
# threadpool): a concurrent rebuild duplicates work, never corrupts.
