/**
 * Reactive saved-views store — named read-plane selections, kept per SUBJECT on the server.
 *
 * These used to live in `localStorage`, so the same signed-in person on another machine found none of
 * their saved searches. They now belong to the user rather than to the browser: `$lib/user-state` reads
 * and writes them through this zone's `capi/v1/user-state/saved-views` proxy, and `localStorage` survives
 * only as a mirror for an auth-off dev stack and an offline tab.
 *
 * The one rule that matters: a document we could not READ is never overwritten. `ready` stays false and
 * every save is refused while `unreadable` holds, because a store answering "cannot read" and a store
 * answering "nothing saved" look identical on an empty list — and only one of them means the user's views
 * are still there. Thin runes wrapper over the pure logic in `saved-views.ts`, as before.
