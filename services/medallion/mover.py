"""A medallion stage mover — one DAG edge, event-driven (FastAPI application entry).

All three movers run THIS module (``medallion.mover:app``) and differ only by ``MEDALLION_*`` env: each
subscribes to its upstream stage's trigger topic, emits a standard OpenLineage transform event
(``inputs=[from_dataset]`` → ``outputs=[to_dataset]`` — the ``DERIVED_FROM`` edge), and publishes the next
stage's trigger. So a single producer event cascades raw→bronze→silver→gold, and because every hop is a
Dapr publish over the instrumented gRPC client, the W3C trace context propagates → one distributed trace.

Idempotent + best-effort: with ``MEDALLION_COMPUTE_ENABLED`` each stage does a REAL in-process Lance write
(the fake-Ray compute) so the cascade produces data, not just provenance; off, it's a pure lineage emit.
The graph MERGEs on run_id, and a compute/publish outage returns ``RETRY`` so the Dapr sidecar redelivers.
Run: ``uvicorn medallion.mover:app``.
