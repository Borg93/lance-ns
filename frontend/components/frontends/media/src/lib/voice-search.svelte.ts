/**
 * Shared state for voice search ("find this voice" — query-by-example
 * navigation, see api.ts).
 *
 * Three concerns live here so they can be shared without prop drilling
 * (mirrors the `features` flags singleton):
 *
 *  - `status` / `built`  one `/api/voice/status` probe gates every voice
 *    affordance (hit-card buttons, the Settings toggle). `probe()` is
 *    idempotent — the search page calls it on mount.
 *
 *  - `pending` + `request()`  THE entry point for starting a voice search
 *    from anywhere: hit cards, the diarization timeline, URL deep-links.
 *    Requests queue in `pending`; the search page (+page.svelte) consumes
 *    them in an `$effect` and runs `/api/voice/similar`. Timeline builders:
 *    call `voiceSearch.request({ docId, turnId | speaker | t }, label?)` —
 *    no props or context needed. (Deep-links work too: `/?voice_doc=…&
 *    voice_turn=…|voice_speaker=…|voice_t=…`.) `requestUpload(file)` is the
 *    same lifecycle for an uploaded clip (the search-bar attach button).
 *
 *  - `includeSameDoc`  the Settings "include same video" toggle (default
 *    OFF → `exclude_same_doc=true` server-side). The search page re-runs an
 *    active voice query immediately when it flips.
