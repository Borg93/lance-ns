"""The periodic storage->graph reconciliation route — a Dapr cron binding fires the back-fill sweep (B4).

A ``bindings.cron`` component POSTs to ``/<binding-name>`` on a schedule; OPTIONS is Dapr's binding-discovery
pre-flight. The sweep reconciles every dataset the graph knows against on-disk Lance and **back-fills** any
write whose lineage event was lost (the outbox gap) — the buildable half of the outbox problem, since a
stateless catalog over object storage has no DB to host a transactional outbox. Guarded by
``require_dapr_token`` so only the sidecar's cron may drive it. The schedule + binding name live in the
chart, not app code (no scheduler thread here). Blocking Lance/S3 reads run in the threadpool.
