    FAILS CLOSED. A registry read ERROR raises ``ServiceUnavailableError`` (503) — it is NOT swallowed to
    ``None``. Swallowing it would route a possibly-BOUND tenant's table to the shared default bucket on a
    transient S3 blip: a tenant-isolation violation caused by a hiccup. Only a clean "not found" (an
    unbound namespace) resolves to ``None`` and the default root.

    DEACTIVATION GATE (P2.3): if the bound warehouse is deactivated, raises ``PermissionDeniedError`` (403) —
    a quarantined warehouse suspends EVERY op on its bound namespaces (the tenant-offboarding step). Status is
    read LIVE, so a deactivate/activate takes effect on the very next request.

    (This docstring previously asserted the opposite — "swallowed to None ... can NEVER break an existing
    flow" — describing the pre-audit behavior while the code below fail-closed. A docstring that lies about
    a fail-open/fail-closed decision is worse than none: it is the sentence a future reader trusts.)
