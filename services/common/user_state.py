"""Per-subject user state on the Dapr state store — a user's own work, kept off their laptop.

The media zone's workflow graph and saved views lived in ``localStorage``, so the same signed-in person
opening the estate on another machine found an empty canvas. This module gives that work a home on the
already-deployed ``lance-statestore`` component (``state.postgresql`` on ``lance-ns-age``, DSN resolved
from OpenBao through the ``lance-secrets`` Dapr secret store — chart/templates/dapr-statestore.yaml).

**Identity is derived, never accepted.** Every function here takes ``subject`` as the VERIFIED token
subject its caller was handed by the OIDC layer. There is deliberately no ``user`` path parameter, body
field or header anywhere in this module or its router: a store keyed on caller-supplied identity is one
missing check away from serving one person's work to another, and a naive test cannot tell the two designs
apart. The stored record additionally CARRIES its owner (:class:`StoredState.subject`), so even a
mis-keyed or hand-edited row cannot be served to the wrong caller — :meth:`UserStateStore.get` refuses a
record whose owner is not the requester.

**Why the key looks like it does.** Dapr prefixes every key it writes with ``<appId>||``, and ``||`` is
RESERVED as that separator: a key containing it is rejected by the sidecar with a 400. Subjects come from
an identity provider, so they are not ours to trust with that constraint, and the obvious fix does not
work — the key travels in the URL PATH of the sidecar's state API, which decodes it, so a
percent-encoded ``%7C%7C`` arrives at the store as ``||`` again. The encoding therefore has to be
decode-stable: base64url (``A-Za-z0-9-_``, padding stripped) cannot express ``|`` at all, whatever an
identity provider puts in ``sub``, and stays reversible so an operator can read a Postgres row back to a
person.

**Transport.** The local Dapr sidecar's HTTP state API, exactly as :mod:`common.secrets` reaches the
secret store — ``http://localhost:<DAPR_HTTP_PORT>/v1.0/state/<store>``. No service opens a Postgres
connection of its own: the component owns the DSN, the schema and the migrations, and the DSN never
touches pod env.
