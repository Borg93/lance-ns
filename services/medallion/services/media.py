"""Media derivation — decode a blob-v2 image into lightweight, inline artifacts.

The heavy original image stays a referenced blob in bronze; a downstream (silver) stage derives small
artifacts from it that are cheap to store *inline*: a thumbnail (downscaled PNG) and a fixed-size embedding
(deterministic pixel features — no ML model). This is the realistic per-stage transform the generic cascade
mover leaves to a distributed job (see ``compute.py``); here it runs in-process so the medallion demo shows
a real multimodal pipeline end to end.
