/**
 * The zone's LIVE CURSORS — `query.live` generators that say *when the estate changed*, so a panel can
 * re-read instead of waking on a timer.
 *
 * Before this, thirteen files in this zone ran `$effect(() => { load(); setInterval(load, 5000) })`. That
 * is a blind poll: it re-reads whether or not anything happened, every panel keeps its own clock (so two
 * views of the same entity disagree for up to 5s), and the cost is paid in full every tick. Measured on
 * the live estate as alice, through `:8090`:
 *
 *     GET /api/events?limit=200                 471_217 bytes
 *     GET /api/events?limit=200&summary=true     46_625 bytes
 *     GET /api/events?limit=1&summary=true          245 bytes   <- the cursor probe
 *     GET /api/runs                             330_103 bytes
 *
 * So the probe below is ~1900x cheaper than the read it gates, and on an idle estate the browser receives
 * nothing at all. The generator runs on the zone (SvelteKit/Bun) server and holds the cursor; SvelteKit
 * streams each yield and owns reconnect (exponential backoff + on `navigator.onLine`) — no hand-rolled
 * SSE, no client cursor bookkeeping. This is `admin/remote/admin.remote.ts`'s discipline (server-held
 * cursor, change-only yields) applied to the read side.
 *
 * Two sources, deliberately, and each surface picks the one that actually reports its changes:
 *
 *  - `lineageFeed` — `GET /events?limit=1&summary=true` on the lineage plane. **Governed per subject**:
 *    an event is returned only if the caller `can_get_metadata` on every dataset it references, so a
 *    non-admin gets a real live feed with no backend change and never learns that an event they cannot
 *    see exists. Everything data-shaped (tables, namespaces, datasets, jobs, runs, columns, models, the
 *    lineage DAG, the outbox backlog) hangs off this.
 *  - `controlCursor` — `GET /v1/events?since=` on the catalog control plane, which is **estate-admin
 *    gated** (`can_observe_events` on the FGA root) and reports *governance* mutations: warehouses,
 *    tenants, grants, promotions. Those never touch a dataset, so they never move the lineage cursor;
 *    the admin surfaces that render them use this instead.
 *
 * KEEPALIVE. A change-only stream is by definition silent on an idle estate, and both the edge
 * (`proxy-read-timeout`) and the zone's own Bun server (`IDLE_TIMEOUT`) sever an idle stream. So a cursor
 * is re-yielded every `KEEPALIVE_MS` even when it has not moved: the bytes keep the stream alive, and
 * because the yielded value is an unchanged *primitive*, `.current` is assigned an equal number and no
 * consumer's `$effect` re-runs. Traffic without a re-read.
 *
 * FAIL QUIET. A probe that 401s, 403s, times out or cannot connect does NOT throw and does not end the
 * stream — it simply does not tick. Every consuming panel already renders its own honest sign-in /
 * denied / offline state from its own read's status; a cursor that threw would replace that with a
 * boundary error and lose it. `jetstreamCursor` is the one exception, and says why.

 *
 * What it yields is a GENERATION, not the buffer head. A `reset` (the caller's cursor fell off the bounded,
 * drop-oldest buffer) is a change the console must re-read on, but it can hand back the very same head
 * number — and an unchanged primitive is exactly what the keepalive relies on NOT waking anyone. So every

/**
 * The JetStream cursor — deliberately NOT one of the two event feeds, and this is the surface where that

 * `/admin/streams` exists to show a wedged or missing consumer. A wedged consumer emits no lineage events
 * and no control events, so driving this panel off either feed would leave it frozen in exactly the
 * incident it is there to catch. Its state is a gauge with no change-event source, so the honest live feed
 * is a server-side probe of the NATS monitor's own totals, yielded only when they move — still no browser
 * timer, still bytes only on change.
 *
 * Unlike the two feeds above this one is NOT self-gating: `/jsz` is unauthenticated by design and reachable
 * only in-cluster, and a remote function is a public HTTP endpoint, so the estate-admin door is made here —
 * the same `fetchMe` check `admin/+layout.server.ts` makes, failing closed on every ambiguity (no token, a
 * 401/403, a timeout, an unreachable catalog, contract drift). Terminal 403, exactly like `controlEvents`.
